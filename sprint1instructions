Download anaconda to run jupyter notebooks or VScode with Juyter notebook extension
place the jupyter notebook and the csv file in the same folder
run anaconda(jupyter), navigate to aforementioned folder and open it from there
Code which doesnt work has been commented, as far as i can tell, its a problem with data types present in csv file
