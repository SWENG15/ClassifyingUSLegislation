the leadership of the Randolph Street Church of Christ in
Huntsville realized that there was a need to have the Gospel
preached to the Black population in the area and were
instrumental in securing Brother Marshall Keeble to hold
gospel meetings for two weeks; the meetings were very
successful, as more than 50 souls were baptized into the
Body of Christ in Huntsville; and
       WHEREAS, over the next several years, the Church of
Christ continued to grow in number and in spirit, and
Brother Keeble continued to deliver uplifting messages;
Brother Keeble ordained five Brothers as Elders, namely C.T.

Emmanuel Vincent; for the next many years, various other
leader figures were ordained in the church; and
       WHEREAS, the Church of Christ has been involved with
many outreach programs to bring Good's Word to the community
and to serve its physical needs as well, including, but not
limited to, Community Awareness Education Forums on
Wednesday nights, yearly free household goods and clothing
drives to the community, and food insecurity distribution;
the congregation has also supported water and food supply
drives for disaster victims in and outside the area,
including Texas, Tennessee, Louisiana, and Michigan; the
church's Blue Spring Road Academy Pre-School and Child
Development Center is scheduled for completion by the end of
March 2023; and
       WHEREAS, a remarkable congregation indeed, the Church
of Christ has been passionately sharing the Word and love of
God, transforming lives, and bringing people together in
fellowship and worship for a whole century; now therefore,
      BE IT RESOLVED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF ALABAMA, BOTH
HOUSES THEREOF CONCURRING, That the Church of Christ in
Huntsville, Alabama, is highly honored on its milestone
