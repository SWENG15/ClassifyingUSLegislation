Page 1SYNOPSIS: 
Under existing law, the Alabama Adoption Code
provides for adoption procedures.
This bill would repeal the Alabama Adoption Code
and replace it with the Alabama Minor Adoption Code and
the Alabama Adult Adoption Code. 
This bill would provide jurisdictional
requirements for adoptions and contests to adoptions
and allow certain courts handling adoption-related
proceedings to communicate with one another.
This bill would require certain individuals to
consent to an adoption, provide limitations as to when
consent may be withdrawn, and provide for the contest
of an adoption in certain situations.
This bill would expand on the confidentiality 
procedures related to adoptions and adoption records.
This bill would provide further for
pre-placement and post-placement investigations of
individuals petitioning to adopt a minor and would
require reference letters, certain background checks,
and other additional records before the adoption of a
minor may be finalized. 
This bill would clarify procedures for a
relative or stepparent to adopt a minor.
This bill would provide for the adoption of an1

Page 2adult, including who may adopt an adult, the procedures
to adopt an adult, and whose consent is required to
adopt an adult.
This bill would provide that an investigation is
not required for the adoption of an adult, unless the
court so orders.
Section 111.05 of the Constitution of Alabama of
2022, prohibits a general law whose purpose or effect
would be to require a new or increased expenditure of
local funds from becoming effective with regard to a
local governmental entity without enactment by a 2/3
vote unless: it comes within one of a number of
specified exceptions; it is approved by the affected
entity; or the Legislature appropriates funds, or
provides a local source of revenue, to the entity for
the purpose.
The purpose or effect of this bill would be to
require a new or increased expenditure of local funds
within the meaning of the amendment. However, the bill
does not require approval of a local governmental
entity or enactment by a 2/3 vote to become effective
because it comes within one of the specified exceptions
contained in the amendment.

preceding the date of the filing of the petition.
(b) A rebuttable presumption that any individual or
agency whose consent is required has impliedly consented to
the adoption, or the relinquishment for adoption, of an
adoptee arises when clear and convincing evidence shows that
the individual or agency has received notification of the
pendency of the adoption proceedings pursuant to Section
26-10E-17 and has failed to answer or otherwise respond to the

establish his paternity of the unborn child under Section
26-17-611 and to register with the putative father registry
pursuant to Section 26-10C-1. If the notified putative father
fails to file this action and register with the putative
father registry, his failure shall be deemed an irrevocable
implied consent to the adoption of the child.

parent's competency or capacity. The court must appoint
independent counsel or a guardian ad litem for an incompetent
or incapacitated parent for whom there has been no such prior
appointment.
(3) A parent of an adoptee who has voluntarily
relinquished the adoptee to the Department of Human Resources,
a similar agency of another state, or a licensed child placing

provides for adoption procedures.
This bill would repeal the Alabama Adoption Code

This bill would provide jurisdictional
requirements for adoptions and contests to adoptions
and allow certain courts handling adoption-related
proceedings to communicate with one another.
This bill would require certain individuals to
consent to an adoption, provide limitations as to when
consent may be withdrawn, and provide for the contest
of an adoption in certain situations.
This bill would expand on the confidentiality 
procedures related to adoptions and adoption records.
This bill would provide further for
pre-placement and post-placement investigations of
individuals petitioning to adopt a minor and would
require reference letters, certain background checks,
and other additional records before the adoption of a
minor may be finalized. 
This bill would clarify procedures for a
relative or stepparent to adopt a minor.
This bill would provide for the adoption of an1

Page 2adult, including who may adopt an adult, the procedures
to adopt an adult, and whose consent is required to
adopt an adult.
This bill would provide that an investigation is
not required for the adoption of an adult, unless the
court so orders.
Section 111.05 of the Constitution of Alabama of
2022, prohibits a general law whose purpose or effect
would be to require a new or increased expenditure of
local funds from becoming effective with regard to a
local governmental entity without enactment by a 2/3
vote unless: it comes within one of a number of
specified exceptions; it is approved by the affected
entity; or the Legislature appropriates funds, or
provides a local source of revenue, to the entity for
the purpose.
The purpose or effect of this bill would be to
require a new or increased expenditure of local funds
within the meaning of the amendment. However, the bill
does not require approval of a local governmental
entity or enactment by a 2/3 vote to become effective
because it comes within one of the specified exceptions
contained in the amendment.

preceding the date of the filing of the petition.
(b) A rebuttable presumption that any individual or
agency whose consent is required has impliedly consented to
the adoption, or the relinquishment for adoption, of an
adoptee arises when clear and convincing evidence shows that
the individual or agency has received notification of the
pendency of the adoption proceedings pursuant to Section
26-10E-17 and has failed to answer or otherwise respond to the

from the date of service of the notice to file an action to
establish his paternity of the unborn child under Section
26-17-611 and to register with the putative father registry
pursuant to Section 26-10C-1. If the notified putative father
fails to file this action and register with the putative

imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have
been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall
be given by the commission to the governor, the majority and

enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all
costs of litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees. The

contrary, a person who fails to pay the amount of a civil
penalty or to contest liability in a timely manner is entitled
to an adjudicative hearing on the violation if:

officer stating the date on which the person received the
notice of violation that was mailed to the person, if not
received by the 10th day after same is mailed.
(2) Within 15 days of the date of actual receipt, the
person requests an administrative adjudicative hearing.

court shall issue an order stating:
(1) Whether the person charged with the civil violation
is liable for the violation; and
(2) If so, the amount of the civil penalty assessed

court.

therein.

hearing may appeal that finding of civil liability to the
circuit court, by filing a notice of appeal with the clerk of
the municipal court. The notice of appeal must be filed not
later than the 14th day after the date on which the municipal
court judge entered the finding of civil liability. The filing
of a notice of appeal shall stay the enforcement of the civil
penalty. An appeal shall be determined by the circuit court by
trial de novo.
Section 9.  The circuit court hearing an appeal shall
use the procedures that apply to criminal proceedings with the
following qualifications:
(1) The proceedings shall retain their civil nature on
appeal with the circuit court applying the preponderance of
the evidence standard.
(2) If the person is adjudicated by the circuit court
to be responsible for payment of a civil penalty, circuit
court costs shall be owed by the person adjudicated
responsible, with 100 percent of those court costs retained by
the circuit court. Court costs in the circuit court shall be
calculated as are court costs for criminal appeals from the
municipal court, and in the event the circuit court finds the
person appealing to not be responsible, no court costs shall
be owed to the county commission.
(3) Regardless of the civil nature of the proceedings,

and law in the civil proceedings in the circuit court.
(5) The county commission shall be responsible for
providing an attorney to represent the county commission and
to prosecute the civil proceedings in the circuit court.
Section 10.  In the event the evidence produced by a
photographic traffic signal enforcement system does not
produce an image of the license plate with sufficient clarity
for a traffic enforcement officer to determine the identity of
the owner, and if the identity cannot otherwise be reliably
established, then no notice of violation may be issued
pursuant to this act. If, however, a notice of violation is
issued, to the degree constitutionally allowed, those issues
related to the identity of the vehicle or its owner shall
affect the weight to be accorded the evidence and shall not
affect its admissibility.
Section 11.  This act shall become effective on the
first day of the third month following its passage and
approval by the Governor, or its otherwise becoming law.253

whether sufficient evidence supports the violation charges. If
a hearing is not held within 20 business days, the parolee
shall be released back to parole supervision  unless the parole
court determines exigent circumstances exist that preclude
holding the hearing within 20 business days .
(b) Upon finding sufficient evidence to support a
parole violation, the parole court may recommend to the board
revocation or reinstatement of parole, and the board may take
any of the following actions:
(1)a. If the underlying offense was a violent offense
as defined in Section 12-25-32 and classified as a Class A

(2) Upon completion of the confinement period and
release from confinement, the parolee shall automatically
continue on parole for the remaining term of the sentence
without further action from the board. The parole court may
not recommend and the board may not revoke parole unless the
parolee has previously received a total of three periods of
confinement under this subsection. A parolee shall receive

subsection may not exceed the term of the parolee's original
sentence.
(4) Confinement shall be immediate. The board shall

(5) If the parolee is presented to a county jail,
excluding a consenting county jail designated for this
purpose, as provided in Section 14-1-23, for any period of
confinement with a serious health condition, if the admittance
of the parolee would create a security risk to the county
jail, or if the county jail is near, at, or over capacity, the
sheriff may refuse to admit the parolee. If, while in custody
of the county jail, the parolee develops a serious health
condition, if the presence of the parolee creates a security
risk to the county jail, or if the county jail reaches near,

applies to the court for leave to produce additional evidence
and shows to the satisfaction of the court that the additional
evidence is material and that there were reasonable grounds
for the failure to produce the evidence in the proceeding
before the commissioner, the court may order the additional
evidence to be taken before the commissioner and be presented
on the hearing in the manner on the terms and conditions the
court may deem proper. The commissioner may modify the
findings of fact or make new findings based on the additional
evidence and may file additional or modified findings that are
supported by the evidence with a recommendation for the
modification or setting aside of the original order or final
determination based on the additional evidence.
(c) An order issued by the commissioner under Section
shall become final:
(1) Upon the expiration of the time allowed for filing
a petition for review if no petition has been duly filed
within that time, except that the commissioner may thereafter
modify or set aside the order to the extent provided in

one million dollars ( $1,000,000 ) in value of real property
investments in the State of Alabama, an insurer shall be
entitled to a credit of 0.10 percent of its Alabama premiums
taxable at the rate specified in paragraph a. of this
subdivision. The total credit allowable for Alabama real

or unimproved Alabama real property acquired or new
construction placed in service on or after January 1, 1993, by
the insurer or an affiliate of the insurer.

real property investments, funds borrowed to finance Alabama
real property investments shall be subtracted from cost so
that only the net cost in the investment properties borne from
assets belonging to the insurer or an affiliate of the insurer
qualifies for the Alabama real property investment credit. The

allocated to that portion of the property not used for
insurance operations shall qualify for the Alabama real
property investment credit.

companies, including the insurer, which are under common
control and management. For an insurer having affiliates, all
premiums of the insurer and its insurance company affiliates
subject to tax at the rate specified in paragraph a. of this
subdivision may be aggregated; all Alabama insurance office
facilities and all Alabama real property investments may be
aggregated; and, subject to the specific credit limitations,
the total allowable tax credits may be determined as if all
the aggregated premiums, office facilities, and Alabama real
property investments were owned by one insurer. Once the total163
190HB80 INTRODUCED
HB80 INTRODUCED
Page 8allowable credits have been determined, the credits may be
allocated to the insurer and its insurance company affiliates
at the sole discretion of the insurer subject to the specific
credit limitations on a per insurance company basis. The

affiliates shall be made on forms to be supplied by the
Alabama Department of Insurance, which forms shall be filed
with the insurer's annual statement.

statement, on a form as furnished or approved by the
commissioner, setting forth the total amount of premiums
received by it for business done in this state during the
period covered by the tax payment. The statement shall be

year on the March 1 payment date in the succeeding calendar
year.

first primary election in 2028 in the county on the continued
levy of the occupational license tax by any municipalities in
the county after the rate of the levy in the municipalities is
reduced to one percent. The question on the ballot shall be as
follows: ""Shall municipalities be allowed to continue
collecting occupational license taxes in Etowah County? ___Yes
___No."" The judge of probate of the county shall prepare the
ballot question on the ballot and tabulate the results. If a
majority of the votes are ""Yes"" and in favor of the continued

or less if the employee's base for employment purposes is
outside of the municipality or to any employee or other worker113

Page 6providing services in the municipality in response to a
natural disaster or other state of emergency declared by the

the effective date of this act, any occupational license tax
levied in a municipality in the county shall not apply to any
severance payments, supplemental unemployment payments,
retirement incentive payments, or any similar payments paid by
an employer to an employee.

authority, or jurisdiction pursuant to Section 11-51-90 of the
Code of Alabama 1975, to license any exhibition, trade,

Under The Alabama Human Life Protection Act,
effective November 15, 2019, a person who performs or
attempts to perform an abortion, except under certain
circumstances to prevent serious health risks to the
mother, is guilty of a felony. 
This bill would repeal The Alabama Human Life
Protection Act.
A BILL
TO BE ENTITLED
AN ACT
Relating to abortion; to provide legislative findings;
and to repeal The Alabama Human Life Protection Act, now
appearing as Chapter 23H of Title 26, Code of Alabama 1975,
providing for criminal penalties for the performance of an
abortion or attempted abortion.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF ALABAMA:
Section 1.  (a) The Legislature finds and declares the
following:
(1) The Alabama Human Life Protection Act, enacted
during the 2019 Regular Session, makes it a felony to perform
an abortion or to attempt an abortion; except for an exception1
28SB34 INTRODUCED
SB34 INTRODUCED
Page 2relating to the health of the mother, the act provides no
other exception to its prohibitions.
(2) This law has been criticized as one of the
strictest abortion laws in the country and even religious
conservatives have questioned the lack of reasonable
exceptions to the prohibition; for example, televangelist Pat
Robertson has labeled the law as ""extreme"" and concluded that
Alabama has ""gone too far.""
(3) Former President Donald Trump also questioned the
reach of this law; he tweeted, ""I am strongly Pro-Life, with
the three exceptions - Rape, Incest and protecting the Life of
the mother - the same position taken by Ronald Reagan.""
(4) The overreach of this law has served as the
catalyst for a tarnished view of our state, which will
negatively impact tourism and our economy; numerous groups
have called for a boycott of our state and other states and
localities have chosen not to authorize the spending of state
resources on travel to our state.
(5) Proponents of the law have conceded that the state
is headed for a long and expensive court battle to defend the
law, which will, in turn, unnecessarily cost the taxpayers of
this state.
(6) Rather than spending state funds on unnecessary and
unfruitful legal battles, our resources would be better served
to address the immediate and urgent needs of Alabamians in
this state, including the following:
a. The infant mortality crisis; in 2017, Alabama had
the fourth worst infant mortality rate in the country: 7.429
56SB34 INTRODUCED
SB34 INTRODUCED
Page 3deaths per 1,000 live births.
b. The rural health care crisis in this state; a lack
of access to health care in rural areas, access to hospitals,
and retention of physicians perpetuates poverty, preventable
diseases and illnesses, and is a significant contributing
factor to Alabama's 49th ranking in the nation for life
expectancy rates.
c. The health insurance crisis; this state's failure to
expand Medicaid has left more than 140,000 Alabamians
uninsured and without access to basic health care.
(b) The Alabama Human Life Protection Act, now
appearing as Chapter 23H of Title 26, Code of Alabama 1975,
providing criminal penalties for the performance of an
abortion or attempted abortion, is repealed. 
Section 2.  This act shall become effective immediately
following its passage and approval by the Governor, or its

Section 111.05 of the Constitution of Alabama of

specified exceptions; it is approved by the affected
entity; or the Legislature appropriates funds, or
provides a local source of revenue, to the entity for
the purpose.
The purpose or effect of this bill would be to
require a new or increased expenditure of local funds
within the meaning of the amendment. However, the bill
does not require approval of a local governmental

111.05 of the Constitution of Alabama of 2022.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF ALABAMA:
Section 1.  Section 13A-6-3, Code of Alabama 1975, is

""§13A-6-3
(a) A person commits the crime of manslaughter if  he or
she does any of the following :

(2) He causes Causes the death of another person under
circumstances that would constitute murder under Section
13A-6-2; except, that he or she causes the death due to a
sudden heat of passion caused by provocation recognized by

Section 2.  Although this bill would have as its purpose
or effect the requirement of a new or increased expenditure of
local funds, the bill is excluded from further requirements
and application under Section 111.05 of the Constitution of
Alabama of 2022, because the bill defines a new crime or

components of our nation's economy, providing more than 15
percent of U.S. supplies, supporting over 300,000 jobs, and
contributing four to five billion dollars to federal and
state treasuries each year; and
WHEREAS, U.S. energy abundance has historically
contributed to the availability of reliable, affordable
energy and increased energy security for the U.S. and its
allies; and
WHEREAS, U.S. citizens depend on natural gas to
produce electricity, including the State of Alabama which
generates 37 percent of its electricity from natural gas;
