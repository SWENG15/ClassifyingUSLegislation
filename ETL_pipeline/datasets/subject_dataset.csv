Be it enacted by the Legislature of West Virginia:  CHAPTER 48. DOMESTIC RELATIONS.  ARTICLE 8. SPOUSAL SUPPORT.  §48-8-103. Payment of spousal support. (a) Upon ordering a divorce or granting a decree of separate maintenance, the court may require either party to pay spousal support in the form of periodic installments, or a lump sum, or both, for the maintenance of the other party. Payments of spousal support are to be ordinarily made from a party’s income, but when the income is not sufficient to adequately provide for those payments, the court may, upon specific findings set forth in the order, order the party required to make those payments to make them from the corpus of his or her separate estate. An award of spousal support shall not be disproportionate to a party’s ability to pay as disclosed by the evidence before the court. (b) At any time after the entry of an order pursuant to the provisions of this article, the court may, upon motion of either party, revise or alter the order concerning the maintenance of the parties, or either of them, and make a new order concerning the same, issuing it forthwith, as the altered circumstances or needs of the parties may render necessary to meet the ends of justice. (c) The court shall direct that all payments ordered for spousal support be made to the Bureau for Child Support Enforcement upon application for support collection services. The bureau may act on behalf of other public authorities responsible for child support enforcement, including the authority to represent the legal interests of or execute documents on behalf of the other public authority in connection with the establishment, enforcement, and collection of support or collection on judgments. (d) After an order of support has been made, the party entitled to receive those payments may file the appropriate documentation with the Bureau for Child Support Enforcement to collect the support owed to the party.  The court may from time to time, on motion of either of the parties, a copy of which is served on the bureau if payments are made through it, or upon motion of the Bureau for Child Support Enforcement, revise or alter the order concerning the maintenance and the payment of it, and may make an order respecting these matters which it might have made in the original proceeding. The Bureau for Child Support Enforcement may bring a motion for contempt of court if the obligor is in arrears in support payments, which includes spousal support. (c) (e) (1) For the purposes of subsection (b) of this section, ""altered circumstances"" includes evidence in the form of genetic testing that establishes that a child conceived during the marriage of the parties is not the child of the former husband, or that a child was born to a woman other than the former wife because of the adultery of the former husband. (2) Prior to admitting evidence of genetic testing, the court shall preliminarily determine whether genetic testing evidence should be admitted for the purpose of disproving or establishing paternity. The facts that may be considered by the court at this hearing include the following: (A) The length of time that has elapsed since the party was first placed on notice that a child conceived during the marriage of the parties is not the child of the former husband, or that a child was born to a woman other than the former wife because of the adultery of the former husband; (B) The length of time during which the individual desiring to challenge paternity assumed the role of parent to the child; (C) The facts surrounding the party’s discovery of nonpaternity; (D) The nature of the parent/child relationship; (E) The age of the child; (F) The harm which may result to the child if paternity were successfully disproved; (G) The extent to which the passage of time reduced the chances of establishing paternity in favor of the child; and (H) All other factors which may affect the equities involved in the potential disruption of the parent/child relationship or the chances of undeniable harm to the child. (d) (f) For the purposes of subsection (c) (e) , genetic testing must be performed pursuant to the following guidelines: (1) The tests show that the inherited characteristics including, but not limited to, blood types, have been determined by appropriate testing procedures at a hospital, independent medical institution or independent medical laboratory duly licensed under the laws of this state, or any other state, and an expert qualified as an examiner of genetic markers has analyzed, interpreted and reported on the results; and (2) The genetic test results exclude the former husband as the father of the child.  article 14. Remedies for the enforcement of support obligations.  §48-14-107. Modification of support order with the assistance of Bureau for Child Support Enforcement. In addition to any other procedure which may exist by law, any party seeking the recalculation of support and modification under a child support order due to a substantial change in circumstances pursuant to the provisions of §48-14-106 and §48-6-301 of this code may seek and obtain the assistance of the Bureau of Child Support Enforcement, pursuant to the procedures established under the provisions of §48-18-201, §48-18-202, §48-18-203, §48-18-204, §48-18-205 , and §48-18-206 of this code, in the preparation, assessment and presentation of an appropriate petition for modification of a support order, including the identification and narrowing of issues associated with a requested recalculation of support prior to filing the petition, and the preparation and presentation of an appropriate petition and proposed order for modification for consideration by the family court.

Obtaining support from federal tax refunds. The Commissioner shall, by legislative rule promulgated pursuant to chapter twenty-nine-a of this code, place in effect procedures necessary for the Bureau for Child Support Enforcement to obtain payment of past due child and spousal support from federal tax refunds from overpayments made to the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States. The Bureau for Child Support Enforcement shall take all steps necessary to implement and utilize such procedures.  §48-18-118. Obtaining support from state income tax refunds. (a) The Tax Commissioner shall establish procedures necessary for the Bureau for Child Support Enforcement to obtain payment of past-due support from state income tax refunds from overpayment made to the Tax Commissioner pursuant to the provisions of article twenty-one, chapter eleven of this code. (b) The Commissioner for the Bureau for Child Support Enforcement shall establish procedures necessary to enforce a support order through a notice to the Tax Commissioner which will cause any refund of state income tax which would otherwise be payable to an obligor to be reduced by the amount of overdue support owed by such obligor. (1) The procedures shall, at a minimum, prescribe: (A) The time or times at which the Bureau for Child Support Enforcement shall serve on the obligor or submit to the Tax Commissioner notices of past-due support; (B) The manner in which such notices shall be served on the obligor or submitted to the Tax Commissioner; (C) The necessary information which shall be contained in or accompany the notices; (D) The amount of the fee to be paid to the Tax Commissioner for the full cost of applying the procedure whereby past-due support is obtained from state income tax refunds; and (E) Circumstances when the Bureau for Child Support Enforcement may deduct a $25 fee from the obligor's state income tax refund. This procedure may not require a deduction from the state income tax refund of an applicant who is a recipient of assistance from the Bureau for Children and Families in the form of temporary assistance for needy families. (2) Withholding from state income tax refunds may not be pursued unless the Bureau for Child Support Enforcement has examined the obligor’s pattern of payment of support and the obligee’s likelihood of successfully pursuing other enforcement actions, and has determined that the amount of past-due support which will be owed, at the time the withholding is to be made, will be $100 or more. In determining whether the amount of past-due support will be $100 or more, the Bureau for Child Support Enforcement shall consider the amount of all unpaid past-due support, including that which may have accrued prior to the time that the Bureau for Child Support Enforcement first agreed to enforce the support order. (c) The Commissioner of the Bureau for Child Support Enforcement shall enter into agreements with the Secretary of the Treasury and the Tax Commissioner, and other appropriate governmental agencies, to secure information relating to the Social Security number or numbers and the address or addresses of any obligor, and the name or names and address or addresses of any employer or employers, in order to provide notice between such agencies to aid the Bureau for Child Support Enforcement in requesting state income tax deductions and to aid the Tax Commissioner in enforcing such deductions. In each such case, the Tax Commissioner, in processing the state income tax deduction, shall notify the Bureau for Child Support Enforcement of the obligor’s home address and Social Security number or numbers. The Bureau for Child Support Enforcement shall provide this information to any other state involved in processing the support order; (d) For the purposes of this section, past-due support means the amount of unpaid past-due support owed under the terms of a support order to or on behalf of a child, or to or on behalf of a minor child and the parent with whom the child is living, or to a spouse under an order of spousal support; regardless of whether the amount has been reduced to a judgment or not. (e) The Bureau for Child Support Enforcement may, under the provisions of this section, enforce the collection of past-due support on behalf of a child who has reached the age of majority. (f) The procedure shall, at a minimum, provide that prior to notifying the Tax Commissioner of past-due support, a notice to the obligor as prescribed under subsection (a) of this section shall: (1) Notify the obligor that a withholding will be made from any refund otherwise payable to such obligor; (2) Instruct the obligor of the steps which may be taken to contest the determination of the Bureau for Child Support Enforcement that past-due support is owed or the amount of the past-due support; and (3) Provide information with respect to the procedures to be followed, in the case of a joint return, to protect the share of the refund which may be payable to another person. (g) If the Bureau for Child Support Enforcement is notified by the Tax Commissioner that the refund from which withholding is proposed to be made is based upon a joint return, and if the past-due support which is involved has not been assigned to the Department of Health and Human Resources, the Bureau for Child Support Enforcement may delay distribution of the amount withheld until such time as the Tax Commissioner notifies the Bureau for Child Support Enforcement that the other person filing the joint return has received his or her proper share of the refund, but such delay shall not exceed six months. (h) In any case in which an amount is withheld by the Tax Commissioner under the provisions of this section and paid to the Bureau for Child Support Enforcement, if the Bureau for Child Support Enforcement subsequently determines that the amount certified as past due was in excess of the amount actually owed at the time the amount withheld is to be distributed, the agency shall pay the excess amount withheld to the obligor thought to have owed the past due support or, in the case of amounts withheld on the basis of a joint return, jointly to the parties filing the return. (i) The amounts received by the Bureau for Child Support Enforcement shall be distributed in accordance with the provisions for distribution set forth in 42 U.S.C. §657.  §48-18-118a.

Be it enacted by the Legislature of West Virginia:  ARTICLE 4. COURT ACTIONS.  §49-4-604. Disposition of neglected or abused children; case plans; dispositions; factors to be considered; reunification; orders; alternative dispositions.   (a) Child and family case plans . — Following a determination pursuant to §49‑4‑602 of this code wherein the court finds a child to be abused or neglected, the department shall file with the court a copy of the child’s case plan, including the permanency plan for the child. The term ""case plan"" means a written document that includes, where applicable, the requirements of the family case plan as provided in §49‑4‑408 of this code and that also includes, at a minimum, the following: (1) A description of the type of home or institution in which the child is to be placed, including a discussion of the appropriateness of the placement and how the agency which is responsible for the child plans to assure that the child receives proper care and that services are provided to the parents, child, and foster or kinship parents in order to improve the conditions that made the child unsafe in the care of his or her parent(s), including any reasonable accommodations in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. §12101 et seq., to parents with disabilities in order to allow them meaningful access to reunification and family preservation services; (2) A plan to facilitate the return of the child to his or her own home or the concurrent permanent placement of the child; and address the needs of the child while in kinship or foster care, including a discussion of the appropriateness of the services that have been provided to the child. The term ""permanency plan"" refers to that part of the case plan which is designed to achieve a permanent home for the child in the least restrictive setting available. The plan mus t shall document efforts to ensure that the child is returned home within approximate timelines for reunification as set out in the plan. Reasonable efforts to place a child for adoption or with a legal guardian should be made at the same time, or concurrent with, reasonable efforts to prevent removal or to make it possible for a child to return to the care of his or her parent(s) safely. If reunification is not the permanency plan for the child, the plan must  shall state why reunification is not appropriate and detail the alternative, concurrent permanent placement plans for the child to include approximate timelines for when the placement is expected to become a permanent placement. This case plan shall serve as the family case plan for parents of abused or neglected children. Copies of the child’s case plan shall be sent to the child’s attorney and parent, guardian or custodian or their counsel at least five days prior to the dispositional hearing. The court shall forthwith proceed to disposition giving both the petitioner and respondents an opportunity to be heard. (b) Requirements for a Guardian ad litem . — A guardian ad litem appointed pursuant to §49‑4‑601(f)(1) of this code, shall, in the performance of  his or her duties, adhere to the requirements of the Rules of Procedure for Child Abuse and Neglect Proceedings and the Rules of Professional Conduct and such other rules as the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals may promulgate, and any appendices thereto, and must  shall meet all educational requirements for the guardian ad litem. A guardian ad litem may not be paid for his or her services without meeting the certification and educational requirements of the court. The West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals is requested to provide guidance to the judges of the circuit courts regarding supervision of said guardians ad litem. The West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals is requested to review the Rules of Procedure for Child Abuse and Neglect Proceedings and the Rules of Professional Conduct specific to guardians ad litem. (c) Disposition decisions . — The court shall give precedence to dispositions in the following sequence: (1) Dismiss the petition; (2) Refer the child, the abusing parent, the battered parent, or other family members to a community agency for needed assistance and dismiss the petition; (3) Return the child to his or her own home under supervision of the department; (4) Order terms of supervision calculated to assist the child and any abusing parent or battered parent or parents or custodian which prescribe the manner of supervision and care of the child, and which are within the ability of any parent or parents or custodian to perform; (5) Upon a finding that the abusing parent or battered parent or parents are presently unwilling or unable to provide adequately for the child’s needs, commit the child temporarily to the care, custody, and control of the department, a licensed private child welfare agency, or a suitable person who may be appointed guardian by the court. The court order shall state: (A) That continuation in the home is contrary to the best interests of the child and why; (B) Whether or not the department has made reasonable efforts, with the child’s health and safety being the paramount concern, to preserve the family, or some portion thereof, and to prevent or eliminate the need for removing the child from the child’s home and to make it possible for the child to safely return home; (C) Whether the department has made reasonable accommodations in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq. , to parents with disabilities in order to allow them meaningful access to reunification and family preservation services; (D) What efforts were made or that the emergency situation made those efforts unreasonable or impossible; and (E) The specific circumstances of the situation which made those efforts unreasonable if services were not offered by the department. The court order shall also determine under what circumstances the child’s commitment to the department are to continue. Considerations pertinent to the determination include whether the child should: (i) Be considered for legal guardianship; (ii) Be considered for permanent placement with a fit and willing relative; or (iii) Be placed in another planned permanent living arrangement, but only in cases where the child has attained 16 years of age and the department has documented to the circuit court a compelling reason for determining that it would not be in the best interests of the child to follow one of the options set forth in subparagraphs (i) or (ii) of this paragraph. The court may order services to meet the special needs of the child. Whenever the court transfers custody of a youth to the department, an appropriate order of financial support by the parents or guardians shall be entered in accordance with §49‑4‑801 through §49‑4‑803 of this code; (6) Upon a finding that there is no reasonable likelihood that the conditions of neglect or abuse can be substantially corrected in the near future and, when necessary for the welfare of the child, terminate the parental, custodial and guardianship rights and responsibilities of the abusing parent and commit the child to the permanent sole custody of the nonabusing parent, if there be one, or, if not, to either the permanent guardianship of the department or a licensed child welfare agency. The court may award sole custody of the child to a nonabusing battered parent. If the court shall so find, then in fixing its dispositional order the court shall consider the following factors: (A) The child’s need for continuity of care and caretakers; (B) The amount of time required for the child to be integrated into a stable and permanent home environment; and (C) Other factors as the court considers necessary and proper. Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, the court shall give consideration to the wishes of a child 14 years of age or older or otherwise of an age of discretion as determined by the court regarding the permanent termination of parental rights. No adoption of a child shall  may take place until all proceedings for termination of parental rights under this article and appeals thereof are final. In determining whether or not parental rights should be terminated, the court shall consider the efforts made by the department to provide remedial and reunification services to the parent. The court order shall state: (i) That continuation in the home is not in the best interest of the child and why; (ii) Why reunification is not in the best interests of the child; (iii) Whether or not the department made reasonable efforts, with the child’s health and safety being the paramount concern, to preserve the family, or some portion thereof, and to prevent the placement or to eliminate the need for removing the child from the child’s home and to make it possible for the child to safely return home, or that the emergency situation made those efforts unreasonable or impossible; and (iv) Whether or not the department made reasonable efforts to preserve and reunify the family, or some portion thereof, including a description of what efforts were made or that those efforts were unreasonable due to specific circumstances. (7) For purposes of the court’s consideration of the disposition custody of a child pursuant to this subsection, the department is not required to make reasonable efforts to preserve the family if the court determines: (A) The parent has subjected the child, another child of the parent or any other child residing in the same household or under the temporary or permanent custody of the parent to aggravated circumstances which include, but are not limited to, abandonment, torture, chronic abuse, and sexual abuse; (B) The parent has: (i) Committed murder of the child’s other parent, guardian or custodian, another child of the parent, or any other child residing in the same household or under the temporary or permanent custody of the parent; (ii) Committed voluntary manslaughter of the child’s other parent, guardian, or custodian, another child of the parent, or any other child residing in the same household or under the temporary or permanent custody of the parent; (iii) Attempted or conspired to commit murder or voluntary manslaughter, or been an accessory before or after the fact to either crime; (iv) Committed a malicious assault that results in serious bodily injury to the child, the child’s other parent, guardian, or custodian, to another child of the parent, or any other child residing in the same household or under the temporary or permanent custody of the parent; (v) Attempted or conspired to commit malicious assault, as outlined in subparagraph (iv), or been an accessory before or after the fact to the same; (vi) Committed sexual assault or sexual abuse of the child, the child’s other parent, guardian, or custodian, another child of the parent, or any other child residing in the same household or under the temporary or permanent custody of the parent; or (vii) Attempted or conspired to commit sexual assault or sexual abuse, as outlined in subparagraph (vi), or been an accessory before or after the fact to the same. (C) The parental rights of the parent to another child have been terminated involuntarily; (D) A parent has been required by state or federal law to register with a sex offender registry, and the court has determined in consideration of the nature and circumstances surrounding the prior charges against that parent, that the child’s interests would not be promoted by a preservation of the family. (d) As used in this section, ""No reasonable likelihood that conditions of neglect or abuse can be substantially corrected"" means that, based upon the evidence before the court, the abusing adult or adults have demonstrated an inadequate capacity to solve the problems of abuse or neglect on their own or with help. Those conditions exist in the following circumstances, which are not exclusive: (1) The abusing parent or parents have habitually abused or are addicted to alcohol, controlled substances, or drugs, to the extent that proper parenting skills have been seriously impaired, and the person or persons have not responded to or followed through the recommended and appropriate treatment which could have improved the capacity for adequate parental functioning; (2) The abusing parent or parents have willfully refused or are presently unwilling to cooperate in the development of a reasonable family case plan designed to lead to the child’s return to their care, custody, and control; (3) The abusing parent or parents have not responded to or followed through with a reasonable family case plan or other rehabilitative efforts of social, medical, mental health, or other rehabilitative agencies designed to reduce or prevent the abuse or neglect of the child, as evidenced by the continuation or insubstantial diminution of conditions which threatened the health, welfare, or life of the child; (4) The abusing parent or parents have abandoned the child; (5) The abusing parent or parents have repeatedly or seriously injured the child physically or emotionally, or have sexually abused or sexually exploited the child, and the degree of family stress and the potential for further abuse and neglect are so great as to preclude the use of resources to mitigate or resolve family problems, or assist the abusing parent or parents in fulfilling their responsibilities to the child; and (6) The battered parent’s parenting skills have been seriously impaired, and the person has willfully refused or is presently unwilling or unable to cooperate in the development of a reasonable treatment plan, or has not adequately responded to or followed through with the recommended and appropriate treatment plan. (e) The court may, as an alternative disposition, allow the parents or custodians an improvement period not to exceed six months. During this period, the court shall require the parent to rectify the conditions upon which the determination was based. The court may order the child to be placed with the parents, or any person found to be a fit and proper person, for the temporary care of the child during the period. At the end of the period, the court shall hold a hearing to determine whether the conditions have been adequately improved and at the conclusion of the hearing shall make a further dispositional order in accordance with this section. (f) For a parent or parents who are participating in a substance use disorder program, prior to reuniting a child with his or her parent or parents, or dismissing the case, the court shall verify that the parent or parents are successfully fulfilling the treatment obligations in the program. (f)  (g) The court may not terminate the parental right of a parent on the sole basis that the parent is participating in a medication-assisted treatment  substance use disorder program, as regulated in §16-5Y-1 et seq. of this code, for substance use disorder as long as the parent is successfully fulfilling his or her treatment obligations in the medication-assisted treatment program.  NOTE: The purpose of this bill is to require a court to verify that before a child who has been removed from a home may be returned to that home, that if a parent is participating in a medication-assisted treatment program he or she shall be successfully fulfilling their treatment obligations in the program.

Factors to be considered in making a determination as to a grant of visitation to a sibling.  In making a determination on a motion or petition the court shall consider the following factors: (1) The age of the minor child; (2) The relationship between the minor child and the sibling; (3) The relationship between each of the minor child’s parents or the person with whom the minor child is residing and the sibling; (4) The time which has elapsed since the minor child last had contact with the sibling; (5) The effect that visitation will have on the relationship between the minor child and the minor child’s parents or the person with whom the minor child is residing; (6) If the parents are divorced or separated, the custody and visitation arrangement which exists between the parents with regard to the minor child; (7) The time available to the minor child and his or her parents, giving consideration to each parent’s employment schedule, the minor child’s schedule for home, school, and community activities, and the minor child’s and parents’ holiday and vacation schedule; (8) The good faith of the sibling in filing the motion or petition; (9) Any history of physical, emotional, or sexual abuse or neglect being performed, procured, assisted, or condoned by the sibling; (10) Whether the minor child has, in the past, resided with the sibling for a significant time, with or without the minor child’s parent or parents; (11) Whether the sibling has, in the past, been a significant caretaker for the minor child, regardless of whether the minor child resided inside or outside of the sibling’s residence; (12) The preference of the parents with regard to the requested visitation; and (13) Any other factor relevant to the best interests of the minor child.  §48-10A-601. Interview of minor child in chambers.  In considering the factors listed in §48-10A-502 of this code for purposes of determining whether to grant visitation, establishing a specific visitation schedule, and resolving any issues related to the making of any determination with respect to visitation or the establishment of any specific visitation schedule, the court may interview in chambers any or all involved minor children regarding their wishes and concerns. No person may be present other than the court, the minor child, the minor child’s attorney or guardian ad litem, if any, and any necessary court personnel.  §48-10A-602. Prohibitions on use of minor child’s written or recorded statement or affidavit; minor child not to be called as a witness.  (a) No person may obtain or attempt to obtain from a minor child a written or recorded statement or affidavit setting forth the wishes and concerns of the minor child regarding sibling visitation matters. The court, in considering the factors listed in §48-10A-502 of this code for purposes of determining whether to grant any visitation, establishing a visitation schedule, or resolving any issues related to the making of any determination with respect to visitation or the establishment of any specific visitation schedule, may not accept or consider such a written or recorded statement or affidavit. (b) A minor child may not be called as a witness in any proceeding to determine whether sibling visitation should be awarded.  §48-10A-701. Proof required when action is pending for divorce, custody, legal separation, annulment, or establishment of paternity.  If a motion for sibling visitation is filed in a pending action for divorce, custody, legal separation, annulment, or establishment of paternity pursuant to §48-10A-401 of this code, the sibling shall be granted visitation if a preponderance of the evidence shows that visitation is in the best interest of the minor child and that: (1) The party to the divorce through which the sibling is related to the minor child has failed to answer or otherwise appear and defend the cause of action; or (2) The location of the party through which the sibling is related to the minor child is unknown to the party bringing the action and to the sibling who filed the motion for visitation.  §48-10A-702. Proof required when action is not pending for divorce, custody, legal separation, annulment, or establishment of paternity.  (a) If a petition is filed pursuant to §48-10A-402 of this code when the parent through whom the sibling is related to the minor child does not: (1) have custody of the minor child; (2) share custody of the minor child; or (3) exercise visitation privileges with the minor child that will allow participation in the visitation by the sibling if the parent so choses, the sibling shall be granted visitation if a preponderance of the evidence shows that visitation is in the best interest of the minor child. (b) If a petition is filed pursuant to §48-10A-402 of this code, there is a presumption that visitation privileges need not be extended to the sibling if the parent through whom the sibling is related to the minor child has custody of the minor child, shares custody of the minor child, or exercises visitation privileges with the minor child that will allow participation in the visitation by the sibling if the parent so chooses. This presumption may be rebutted by clear and convincing evidence that an award of sibling visitation is in the best interest of the minor child.  §48-10A-801. Order granting or refusing sibling visitation shall state findings of fact and conclusions of law.  An order granting or refusing the sibling’s motion or petition for visitation shall state in writing the court’s findings of fact and conclusions of law.  §48-10A-802. Supervised visitation; conditions on visitation.  The court may enter an order granting visitation privileges to a sibling that may require supervised visitation, or the court may place conditions on visitation that it finds are in the best interests of the minor child, including, but not limited to, the following: (1) That the sibling does not attempt to influence any religious beliefs or practices of the minor children in a manner contrary to the preferences of the minor child’s parents; (2) That the sibling does not engage in, permit or encourage activities, or expose the minor child to conditions or circumstances, that are contrary to the preferences of the minor child’s parents; or (3) That the sibling does not otherwise act in a manner to contradict or interfere with child-rearing decisions made by the minor child’s parents.  §48-10A-901. Effect of remarriage of the custodial parent.  The remarriage of the custodial parent of a minor child does not affect the authority of a circuit court or family court to grant reasonable visitation to any sibling.  §48-10A-902. Effect of adoption of the minor child.  If a minor child who is subject to a sibling visitation order under this article is later adopted, the order for sibling visitation is automatically vacated when the order for adoption is entered, unless the adopting parent is a stepparent, grandparent, or other relative of the minor child; however, once the order for adoption is entered, the sibling may repetition the court seeking sibling visitation with the minor child.  §48-10A-1001. Continuing jurisdiction of circuit court or family court.  Any circuit court or family court that grants visitation rights to a sibling retains jurisdiction throughout the minority of the minor child with whom visitation is granted to modify or terminate the rights as dictated by the best interests of the minor child.  §48-10A-1002. Termination of sibling visitation.  A circuit court or family court shall, based upon a petition brought by an interested person, terminate any grant of the right of sibling visitation upon presentation of a preponderance of the evidence that a sibling granted visitation has materially violated the terms and conditions of the order of visitation.  §48-10A-1101. Attorney’s fees; reasonable costs.  In an action brought under the provisions of this article, a circuit court or family court may order payment of reasonable attorney’s fees and costs based upon the equities of the positions asserted by the parties to pay the fees and costs.  §48-10A-1201. Misdemeanor offense for allowing contact between minor child and person who has been precluded visitation rights; penalties.  Any sibling who knowingly allows contact between a minor child and a parent or other person who has been precluded visitation rights with the minor child by court order is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be confined in jail not more than 30 days or fined not less than $100 nor more than $1,000.

(b) If an action for divorce, annulment, or separate maintenance does not require the establishment of a parenting plan or other allocation of custodial responsibility or decision-making responsibility for a child and does not require an award or any payment of child support, the circuit court has concurrent jurisdiction with the family court over the action if, at the time of the filing of the action, the parties also file a written property settlement agreement executed by both parties. (c) If an action for divorce, annulment, or separate maintenance is pending and a petition is filed pursuant to the provisions of §49-4-601 through §49-4-610 of this code alleging abuse or neglect of a child by either of the parties to the divorce, annulment, or separate maintenance action, the orders of the circuit court in which the abuse or neglect petition is filed shall supersede and take precedence over an order of the family court respecting the allocation of custodial and decision-making responsibility for the child between the parents. If no order for the allocation of custodial and decision-making responsibility for the child between the parents has been entered by the family court in the pending action for divorce, annulment, or separate maintenance, the family court shall stay any further proceedings concerning the allocation of custodial and decision-making responsibility for the child between the parents and defer to the orders of the circuit court in the abuse or neglect proceedings.

A family court may not exercise the powers given courts of record in §51-5-1 of this code or exercise any other powers provided for courts of record in this code unless specifically authorized by the Legislature.

This act shall be known as ""Raylee’s Law."" Be it enacted by the Legislature of West Virginia:   ARTICLE 8. COMPULSORY SCHOOL ATTENDANCE.  §18-8-1.  Compulsory school attendance; exemptions.  (a) Exemption from the requirements of compulsory public school attendance established in §18-8-1a of this code shall be made on behalf of any child for the causes or conditions set forth in this section. Each cause or condition set forth in this section is subject to confirmation by the attendance authority of the county. A child who is exempt from compulsory school attendance under this section is not subject to prosecution under §18-8-2 of this code, nor is such a child a status offender as defined by §49-1-202 of this code. (b) A child is exempt from the compulsory school attendance requirement set forth in §18-8-1a of this code if the requirements of this subsection, relating to instruction in a private, parochial or other approved school, are met. The instruction shall be in a school approved by the county board and for a time equal to the instructional term set forth in §18-5-45 of this code. In all private, parochial or other schools approved pursuant to this subsection it is the duty of the principal or other person in control, upon the request of the county superintendent, to furnish to the county board such information and records as may be required with respect to attendance, instruction and progress of students enrolled. (c) A child is exempt from the compulsory school attendance requirement set forth in §18-8-1a of this code if the requirements of either subdivision (1) or subdivision (2) of this subsection, both relating to home instruction, are met. (1) The instruction shall be in the home of the child or children or at some other place approved by the county board and for a time equal to the instructional term set forth in §18-5-45 of this code:  Provided , That the county board may not authorize instruction in the home if there is a pending child abuse or neglect investigation pursuant to §49-2-801 et seq. of this code against either custodial parent or a person instructing the child, or if either custodial parent or a person instructing the child has ever been convicted of domestic violence pursuant to §48-27-101 et seq. of this code or child abuse or neglect pursuant to §61-8D-1 et seq . of this code. If the request for home instruction is denied by the county board, good and reasonable justification for the denial shall be furnished in writing to the applicant by the county board. The instruction shall be conducted by a person or persons who, in the judgment of the county superintendent and county board, are qualified to give instruction in subjects required to be taught in public elementary schools in the state. The person or persons providing the instruction, upon request of the county superintendent, shall furnish to the county board information and records as may be required periodically with respect to attendance, instruction and progress of students receiving the instruction. The state board shall develop guidelines for the home schooling of special education students including alternative assessment measures to assure that satisfactory academic progress is achieved. (2) The child meets the requirements set forth in this subdivision: Provided, That the county superintendent may, after a showing of probable cause, seek from the circuit court of the county an order denying home instruction of the child. The order may be granted upon a showing of clear and convincing evidence that the child will suffer neglect in his or her education or that there are other compelling reasons to deny home instruction. (A) Upon commencing home instruction under this section the parent of a child receiving home instruction shall present to the county superintendent or county board a notice of intent to provide home instruction  that includes the name, address, and age  of any child of compulsory school age to be instructed and assurance that the child shall receive instruction in reading, language, mathematics, science and social studies and that the child shall be assessed annually in accordance with this subdivision. The person providing home instruction shall notify the county superintendent upon termination of home instruction for a child who is of compulsory attendance age. Upon establishing residence in a new county, the person providing home instruction shall notify the previous county superintendent and submit a new notice of intent to the superintendent of the new county of residence: Provided, That if a child is enrolled in a public school, notice of intent to provide home instruction shall be given on or before the date home instruction is to begin. (B) The person or persons providing home instruction shall submit satisfactory evidence of a high school diploma or equivalent, or a post-secondary degree or certificate from a regionally accredited institution or from an institution of higher education that has been authorized to confer a post-secondary degree or certificate in West Virginia by the West Virginia Council for Community and Technical College Education or by the West Virginia Higher Education Policy Commission. (C)  Annually, the person or persons providing home instruction shall obtain an academic assessment of the child for the previous school year in one of the following ways: (i) The child receiving home instruction takes a nationally normed standardized achievement test published or normed not more than ten years from the date of administration and administered under the conditions as set forth by the published instructions of the selected test and by a person qualified in accordance with the test's published guidelines in the subjects of reading, language, mathematics, science and social studies.   The child is considered to have made acceptable progress when the mean of the child’s test results in the required subject areas for any single year is within or above the fourth stanine or, if below the fourth stanine, shows improvement from the previous year’s results; (ii) The child participates in the testing program currently in use in the state’s public schools. The test shall be administered to the child at a public school in the county of residence. Determination of acceptable progress shall be based on current guidelines of the state testing program; (iii)  A portfolio of samples of the child’s work is reviewed by a certified teacher who determines whether the child’s academic progress for the year is in accordance with the child’s abilities.  The teacher shall provide a written narrative about the child’s progress in the areas of reading, language, mathematics, science and social studies and shall note any areas which, in the professional opinion of the reviewer, show need for improvement or remediation. If the narrative indicates that the child’s academic progress for the year is in accordance with the child’s abilities, the child is considered to have made acceptable progress; or (iv) The child completes an alternative academic assessment of proficiency that is mutually agreed upon by the parent or legal guardian and the county superintendent. (D) A parent or legal guardian shall maintain copies of each student’s Academic Assessment for three years. When the annual assessment fails to show acceptable progress, the person or persons providing home instruction shall initiate a remedial program to foster acceptable progress. The county board upon request shall notify the parents or legal guardian of the child, in writing, of the services available to assist in the assessment of the child’s eligibility for special education services. Identification of a disability does not preclude the continuation of home schooling.  In the event that the child does not achieve acceptable progress for a second consecutive year, the person or persons providing instruction shall submit to the county superintendent additional evidence that appropriate instruction is being provided.  (E) The parent or legal guardian shall submit to the county superintendent the results of the academic assessment of the child at grade levels three, five, eight and 11, as applicable, by June 30 of the year in which the assessment was administered. (3) This subdivision applies to both home instruction exemptions set forth in subdivisions (1) and (2) of this subsection. The county superintendent or a designee shall offer such assistance, including textbooks, other teaching materials and available resources, all subject to availability, as may assist the person or persons providing home instruction. Any child receiving home instruction may upon approval of the county board exercise the option to attend any class offered by the county board as the person or persons providing home instruction may consider appropriate subject to normal registration and attendance requirements. (d) A child is exempt from the compulsory school attendance requirement set forth in section one-a of this article if the requirements of this subsection, relating to physical or mental incapacity, are met. Physical or mental incapacity consists of incapacity for school attendance and the performance of schoolwork. In all cases of prolonged absence from school due to incapacity of the child to attend, the written statement of a licensed physician or authorized school nurse is required. Incapacity shall be narrowly defined and in any case the provisions of this article may not allow for the exclusion of the mentally, physically, emotionally or behaviorally handicapped child otherwise entitled to a free appropriate education. (e) A child is exempt from the compulsory school attendance requirement set forth in section one-a of this article if conditions rendering school attendance impossible or hazardous to the life, health or safety of the child exist. (f) A child is exempt from the compulsory school attendance requirement set forth in §18-8-1a of this code upon regular graduation from a standard senior high school or alternate secondary program completion as determined by the state board. (g) A child is exempt from the compulsory school attendance requirement set forth in §18-8-1a of this code if the child is granted a work permit pursuant to the subsection. After due investigation the county superintendent may grant work permits to youths under the termination age designated in §18-8-1a of this code, subject to state and federal labor laws and regulations. A work permit may not be granted on behalf of any youth who has not completed the eighth grade of school. (h) A child is exempt from the compulsory school attendance requirement set forth in §18-8-1a of this code if a serious illness or death in the immediate family of the child has occurred. It is expected that the county attendance director will ascertain the facts in all cases of such absences about which information is inadequate and report the facts to the county superintendent. (i) A child is exempt from the compulsory school attendance requirement set forth in §18-8-1a of this code if the requirements of this subsection, relating to destitution in the home, are met. Exemption based on a condition of extreme destitution in the home may be granted only upon the written recommendation of the county attendance director to the county superintendent following careful investigation of the case. A copy of the report confirming the condition and school exemption shall be placed with the county director of public assistance. This enactment contemplates every reasonable effort that may properly be taken on the part of both school and public assistance authorities for the relief of home conditions officially recognized as being so destitute as to deprive children of the privilege of school attendance. Exemption for this cause is not allowed when the destitution is relieved through public or private means. (j) A child is exempt from the compulsory school attendance requirement set forth in §18-8-1a of this code if the requirements of this subsection, relating to church ordinances and observances of regular church ordinances, are met. The county board may approve exemption for religious instruction upon written request of the person having legal or actual charge of a child or children. This exemption is subject to the rules prescribed by the county superintendent and approved by the county board. (k) A child is exempt from the compulsory school attendance requirement set forth in §18-8-1a of this code if the requirements of this subsection, relating to alternative private, parochial, church or religious school instruction, are met. Exemption shall be made for any child attending any private school, parochial school, church school, school operated by a religious order or other nonpublic school which elects to comply with the provisions of §18-28-1 et seq. of this code. (l) Completion of the eighth grade does not exempt any child under the termination age designated in §18-8-1a of this code from the compulsory attendance provision of this article.  NOTE: The purpose of this bill is to prohibit home schooling of any child in homes where there is suspected or known child abuse or neglect, or domestic violence by a parent or person instructing the child. This shall be known as ""Raylee’s Law.""

1679560,Removal of Mandatory Homeschool Reporting,"""WEST VIRGINIA LEGISLATURE 2023 REGULAR SESSION Introduced House Bill 3048 By Delegates Dillon, Chiarelli, and Crouse [Introduced January 25, 2023; Referred to the Committee on Education] A BILL to amend and reenact §18-8-1 of the Code of West Virginia, 1931, as amended, relating to removing the reporting of assessments and portfolio reviews to county boards of home schooled children. Be it enacted by the Legislature of West Virginia:   ARTICLE 8. COMPULSORY SCHOOL ATTENDANCE.  §18-8-1 . Compulsory school attendance; exemptions.  (a) Exemption from the requirements of compulsory public school attendance established in §18-8-1a of this code shall be made on behalf of any child for the causes or conditions set forth in this section. Each cause or condition set forth in this section is subject to confirmation by the attendance authority of the county. A child who is exempt from compulsory school attendance under this section is not subject to prosecution under §18-8-2 of this code, nor is such a child a status offender as defined by §49-1-202 of this code. (b) A child is exempt from the compulsory school attendance requirement set forth in § 18-8-1a of this code if the requirements of this subsection, relating to instruction in a private, parochial, or other approved school, are met. The instruction shall be in a school approved by the county board and for a time equal to the instructional term set forth in §18-5-45 of this code. In all private, parochial, or other schools approved pursuant to this subsection, it is the duty of the principal or other person in control, upon the request of the county superintendent, to furnish to the county board such information and records as may be required with respect to attendance, instruction, and progress of students enrolled. (c) A child is exempt from the compulsory school attendance requirement set forth in §18-8-1a of this code if the requirements of either subdivision (1) or subdivision (2) of this subsection, both relating to home instruction, are met. (1) The instruction shall be in the home of the child or children or at some other place approved by the county board and for a time equal to the instructional term set forth in §18-5-45 of this code. If the request for home instruction is denied by the county board, good and reasonable justification for the denial shall be furnished in writing to the applicant by the county board. The instruction shall be conducted by a person or persons who, in the judgment of the county superintendent and county board, are qualified to give instruction in subjects required to be taught in public elementary schools in the state. The person or persons providing the instruction, upon request of the county superintendent, shall furnish to the county board information and records as may be required periodically with respect to attendance, instruction, and progress of students receiving the instruction. The state board shall develop guidelines for the home schooling of special education students including alternative assessment measures to assure that satisfactory academic progress is achieved  Because the Legislature recognizes the rights of parents to direct the education and instruction of their own children, the Legislature finds that the reporting of assessments and portfolio reviews to the county boards is currently an immaterial formality which costs parents in time and resources to fulfill. (2) The child meets the requirements set forth in this subdivision: Provided , That the county superintendent may, after a showing of probable cause, seek from the circuit court of the county an order denying home instruction of the child. The order may be granted upon a showing of clear and convincing evidence that the child will suffer neglect in his or her education or that there are other compelling reasons to deny home instruction. (A) Upon commencing home instruction under this section the parent of a child receiving home instruction shall present to the county superintendent or county board a notice of intent to provide home instruction that includes the name, address, and age of any child of compulsory school age to be instructed and assurance that the child shall receive instruction in reading, language, mathematics, science, and social studies, and that the child shall be assessed annually in accordance with this subdivision.

The child is considered to have made acceptable progress when the mean of the child’s test results in the required subject areas for any single year is within or above the fourth stanine or, if below the fourth stanine, shows improvement from the previous year’s results ; (ii) The child participates in the testing program currently in use in the state’s public schools. The test shall be administered to the child at a public school in the county of residence. Determination of acceptable progress shall be based on current guidelines of the state testing program; (iii) A portfolio of samples of the child’s work is reviewed by a certified teacher who determines whether the child’s academic progress for the year is in accordance with the child’s abilities. The teacher shall provide a written narrative about the child’s progress in the areas of reading, language, mathematics, science, and social studies and shall note any areas which, in the professional opinion of the reviewer, show need for improvement or remediation.

1674862,To modify parenting if father encouraged an abortion,"""WEST VIRGINIA LEGISLATURE 2023 REGULAR SESSION Introduced House Bill 2926 By Delegate C. Pritt [Introduced January 23, 2023; Referred to the Committee on the Judiciary] A BILL to amend and reenact §48-9-102a, §48-9-206 and §48-9-209 of the Code of West Virginia, relating to the presumption of 50-50 parental custody of children in child custody court proceedings; deviation from the presumption of 50-50 custody upon clear and convincing evidence that the father encouraged the mother to get an abortion. Be it enacted by the Legislature of West Virginia:  ARTICLE 9. ALLOCATION OF CUSTODIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND DECISION-MAKING RESPONSIBILITY OF CHILDREN.  §48-9-102a Presumption in favor of equal (50-50) custodial allocation.  There shall be a presumption, rebuttable by a preponderance of the evidence, that equal (50-50) custodial allocation is in the best interest of the child. If the presumption is rebutted, the court shall, absent an agreement between the parents as to all matters related to custodial allocation, construct a parenting time schedule which maximizes the time each parent has with the child and is consistent with ensuring the child’s welfare: Provided, That this presumption is rebutted and the court may deviate from allocating custodial time the child spends with each parent equally (50-50) if the court finds from clear and convincing evidence that the father encouraged the mother to get an abortion.  §48-9-206. Allocation of custodial responsibility at final hearing.  (a) Unless otherwise resolved by agreement of the parents under §48-9-201 of this code or unless harmful to the child, the court shall allocate custodial responsibility so that, except to the extent required under §48-9-209 of this code, the custodial time the child spends with each parent shall be equal (50-50): Provided, That the court may deviate from allocating custodial time the child spends with each parent equally (50-50) if the court finds from clear and convincing evidence that the father encouraged the mother to get an abortion. (b) The court shall apply the principles set forth in §48-9-403 of this code if one parent relocates or proposes to relocate at a distance that will impair the ability of a parent to exercise the amount of custodial responsibility that would otherwise be ordered under this section. (c) The court may consider the allocation of custodial responsibility arising from temporary agreements made by the parties after separation if the court finds, by a preponderance of the evidence, that such agreements were consensual.  The court shall afford those temporary consensual agreements the weight the court believes the agreements are entitled to receive, based upon the evidence.  The court may not consider the temporary allocation of custodial responsibility imposed by a court order on the parties unless both parties agreed to the allocation provided for in the temporary order. (d) In the absence of an agreement of the parents, the court’s determination of allocation of custodial responsibility under this section shall be made pursuant to a final hearing, which shall be conducted by the presentation of evidence. The court’s order determining allocation of custodial responsibility shall be in writing, and include specific findings of fact and conclusions of law supporting the determination.  §48-9-209. Parenting plan; considerations.  (a) When entering an order approving or implementing a temporary or permanent parenting plan order, including custodial allocation, the court shall consider whether a parent: (1) Has abused, neglected, or abandoned a child, as defined by state law; (2) Has sexually assaulted or sexually abused a child as those terms are defined in §61-8B-1 et seq . and §61-8D-1 et seq . of this code; (3) Has committed domestic violence, as defined in §48-27-202 of this code; (4) Has overtly or covertly, persistently violated, interfered with, impaired, or impeded the rights of a parent or a child with respect to the exercise of shared authority, residence, visitation, or other contact with the child, except in the case of actions taken for the purpose of protecting the safety of the child or the interfering parent or another family member, pending adjudication of the facts underlying that belief; or (5) Has made one or more fraudulent reports of domestic violence or child abuse: Provided , That a person’s withdrawal of or failure to pursue a report of domestic violence or child support shall not alone be sufficient to consider that report fraudulent. (b) If a parent ­or another person regularly in the household of the parent is found to have engaged in any activity specified by subsection (a) of this section, the court shall impose limits that are reasonably calculated to protect the child or child’s parent from harm. The limitations that the court shall consider include, but are not limited to: (1) An adjustment of the custodial responsibility of the parents, including but not limited to: (A) Increased parenting time with the child to make up for any parenting time the other parent lost as a result of the proscribed activity; (B) An additional allocation of parenting time in order to repair any adverse effect upon the relationship between the child and the other parent resulting from the proscribed activity; or (C) The allocation of exclusive custodial responsibility to one of the parents; (2) Supervision of the custodial time between a parent and the child; (3) Exchange of the child between parents through an intermediary, or in a protected setting; (4) Restraints on the parent from communication with, or proximity to, the other parent or the child; (5) A requirement that the parent abstain from possession or consumption of alcohol or nonprescribed drugs while exercising custodial responsibility and in the 24-hour period immediately preceding such exercise; (6) Denial of overnight custodial responsibility; (7) Restrictions on the presence of specific persons while the parent is with the child; (8) A requirement that the parent post a bond to secure return of the child following a period in which the parent is exercising custodial responsibility or to secure other performance required by the court; (9) A requirement that the parent complete a program of intervention for perpetrators of domestic violence, for drug or alcohol abuse, or a program designed to correct another factor; or (10) Any other constraints or conditions that the court determines to be necessary to provide for the safety of the child, a child’s parent, or any person whose safety immediately affects the child’s welfare. (c) If a parent or a person regularly in the home of the parent is found to have engaged in any activity specified in subsection (a) of this section, the court may not allocate custodial responsibility or decision-making responsibility to that parent without making special written findings that the child and other parent can be adequately protected from harm by such limits as it may impose under subsection (b) of this section. The parent found to have engaged in the behavior specified in subsection (a) of this section has the burden of proving that an allocation of custodial responsibility or decision-making responsibility to that parent will not endanger the child or the other parent. (d) If the court determines, based on the investigation described in part III of this article or other evidence presented to it, that an accusation of child abuse or neglect, or domestic violence made during a child custody proceeding is false and the parent making the accusation knew it to be false at the time the accusation was made, the court may order reimbursement to be paid by the person making the accusations of costs resulting from defending against the accusations. The reimbursement may not exceed the actual reasonable costs incurred by the accused party as a result of defending against the accusation and reasonable attorney’s fees incurred. (e) (1) A parent who believes he or she is the subject of activities by the other parent described in subdivision (5), subsection (a) of this section may move the court pursuant to §49-5-101(b)(4) of this code for the Department of Health and Human Resources to disclose whether the other parent was the source of the allegation and, if so, whether the department found the report to be: (A) Substantiated; (B) Unsubstantiated; (C) Inconclusive; or (D) Still under investigation. (2) If the court grants a motion pursuant to this subsection, disclosure by the Department of Health and Human Resources shall be in camera. The court may disclose to the parties information received from the department only if it has reason to believe a parent knowingly made a false report. (f) In determining whether the presumption for an equal (50-50) allocation of physical custody has been rebutted, a court shall consider all relevant factors including any of the following: (1) The factors set forth in subsection (a) of this section; (2) Whether the child: (A) Was conceived as a result of sexual assault or sexual abuse by a parent as set forth in §48-9-209a of this code; (B) Has special needs, a chronic illness, or other serious medical condition and would receive more appropriate care under another custodial allocation; (C) Is a nursing child less than six months of age, or less than one year of age if the child receives substantial nutrition through nursing: Provided , That the child reaching one year of age shall qualify as a substantial change in circumstances per §48-9-401 of this code; or (D) Will be separated from his or her siblings or the arrangement would otherwise disrupt the child’s opportunities to bond with his or her siblings; (3) Whether a parent: (A) Is willfully noncompliant with a previous order of the court regarding payment of child support payments for a child or children of the parties; (B) Is unwilling to seek necessary medical intervention for the child who has a serious medical condition; (C) Has a chronic illness or other condition that renders him or her unable to provide proper care for the child; (D) Has intentionally avoided or refused involvement or not been significantly involved in the child’s life prior to the hearing, except when the lack of involvement is the result of actions on the part of the other parent which were, without good cause, designed to deprive the parent of contact and involvement with his or her child or children without good cause; (E) Repeatedly causes the child or children to be in the care of a third party rather than the other parent when he or she is available; (F) Does not have a stable housing situation: Provided , That a parent’s temporary residence with a child in a domestic violence shelter shall not constitute an unsafe housing situation; or (G) Is unwilling or unable to perform caretaking functions for the child as required by §48-1-210 of this code; (4) Whether a parent, partner, or other person living, or regularly in that parent’s household: (A) Has been adjudicated in an abuse and neglect proceeding to have abused or neglected a child, or has a pending abuse and neglect case; (B) Has been judicially determined to have committed domestic violence or has a pending domestic violence case; (C) Has a felony criminal record; (D) Is addicted to a controlled substance or alcohol; (E) Has threatened or has actually detained the child with the intent to retain or conceal the child from the other parent or from a third person who has legal custody: Provided , That a  parent’s temporary residence with the child in a domestic violence shelter shall not be construed as evidence of the parent’s intent to retain or conceal the child from the other parent; or (F) Has been involuntarily committed to a mental health facility, or suffers from a serious  mental illness; (5) Whether an equal (50-50) physical allocation is: (A) Impractical because of the physical distance between the parents’ residences; (B) Impractical due to the cost and difficulty of transporting the child; (C) Impractical due to each parent’s and the child’s daily schedules; (D) Would disrupt the education of the child; or (E) Contrary to the firm and reasonable preferences of a child who is 14 years of age or older; and to accommodate, if the court determines it is in the best interests of the child, the firm and reasonable preferences of a child under 14 years of age, but sufficiently matured that he or she can intelligently express a voluntary preference for one parent; (6) Whether the parents cannot work cooperatively and collaboratively in the best interest of the child; or (7) Whether a parent will encourage and accept a positive relationship between the child and the other parent, including which parent is more likely to keep the other parent involved in the child’s life and activities; or (8) Whether the presumption of equal physical allocation has been rebutted if the court finds from clear and convincing evidence that the father encouraged the mother to get an abortion.  NOTE: The purpose of this bill is to provide that the presumption of 50-50 parental custody of children in child custody court proceedings is rebutted and the court may deviate from the presumption of 50-50 custody upon clear and convincing evidence that the father encouraged the mother to get an abortion.

(C)  Annually, the person or persons providing home instruction shall obtain an academic assessment of the child for the previous school year in one of the following ways: (i) The child receiving home instruction takes a nationally normed standardized achievement test published or normed not more than ten years from the date of administration and administered under the conditions as set forth by the published instructions of the selected test and by a person qualified in accordance with the test's published guidelines in the subjects of reading, language, mathematics, science and social studies.   The child is considered to have made acceptable progress when the mean of the child’s test results in the required subject areas for any single year  is within or above the fourth stanine or, if below the fourth stanine, shows improvement from the previous year’s results; (ii) The child participates in the testing program currently in use in the state’s public schools. The test shall be administered to the child at a public school in the county of residence. Determination of acceptable progress shall be based on current guidelines of the state testing program; (iii)  A portfolio of samples of the child’s work is reviewed by a certified teacher who determines whether the child’s academic progress for the year is in accordance with the child’s abilities.  The teacher shall provide a written narrative about the child’s progress in the areas of reading, language, mathematics, science and social studies and shall note any areas which, in the professional opinion of the reviewer, show need for improvement or remediation. If the narrative indicates that the child’s academic progress for the year is in accordance with the child’s abilities, the child is considered to have made acceptable progress; or (iv) The child completes an alternative academic assessment of proficiency that is mutually agreed upon by the parent or legal guardian and the county superintendent (D)  (C) A parent or legal guardian shall maintain copies of each student’s Academic Assessment for three years. When the annual assessment fails to show acceptable progress, the person or persons providing home instruction shall initiate a remedial program to foster acceptable progress. The county board upon request shall notify the parents or legal guardian of the child, in writing, of the services available to assist in the assessment of the child’s eligibility for special education services. Identification of a disability does not preclude the continuation of home schooling.  In the event that the child does not achieve acceptable progress for a second consecutive year, the person or persons providing instruction shall submit to the county superintendent additional evidence that appropriate instruction is being provided. (E)  (D) The parent or legal guardian shall submit to the county superintendent the results of the academic assessment of the child at grade levels three, five, eight and 11, as applicable, by June 30 of the year in which the assessment was administered. (3) This subdivision applies to both home instruction exemptions set forth in subdivisions (1) and (2) of this subsection. The county superintendent or a designee shall offer such assistance, including textbooks, other teaching materials and available resources, all subject to availability, as may assist the person or persons providing home instruction. Any child receiving home instruction may upon approval of the county board exercise the option to attend any class offered by the county board as the person or persons providing home instruction may consider appropriate subject to normal registration and attendance requirements. (d) A child is exempt from the compulsory school attendance requirement set forth in §18-8-1a of this code if the requirements of this subsection, relating to physical or mental incapacity, are met. Physical or mental incapacity consists of incapacity for school attendance and the performance of schoolwork. In all cases of prolonged absence from school due to incapacity of the child to attend, the written statement of a licensed physician or authorized school nurse is required. Incapacity shall be narrowly defined and in any case the provisions of this article may not allow for the exclusion of the mentally, physically, emotionally or behaviorally handicapped child otherwise entitled to a free appropriate education.

(l) Completion of the eighth grade does not exempt any child under the termination age designated in section one-a of this article from the compulsory attendance provision of this article.

ARTICLE 10. EXEMPTION FROM WEST VIRGINIA DIVISON OF PERSONNEL.  §49-10-101. Legislative findings.  The Legislature finds the State of West Virginia is experiencing a child welfare crisis.  From 2016 to 2020, the child protective service vacancy rate has increased from 9.7 percent to 33 percent. This significant lack of staffing has caused a delay in response times to begin investigations. During the same time period, the average hours to start a child protective service investigation after referral went from 119.1 hours in 2016 to now averaging 428.1 hours in 2020. This significant failure to begin the investigation can and has cost lives. The Legislature finds that the Bureau for Social Services is having extreme difficulty recruiting and retaining child protective service workers, youth service workers, adult protective service workers, and other related workers, including necessary casework support personnel and managers at the county level, who assist in the provision of services to vulnerable populations.  §49-10-102.  Bureau for Social Service employees exempt from Division of Personnel. (a) The commissioner of the West Virginia Bureau for Social Services shall develop a special merit-based system, including an application appointment procedure for child protective service workers, youth service workers, and adult protective workers, including necessary casework support personnel and managers at the county level, who assist in the provision of services to vulnerable populations. The procedure shall include classification specifications, and may include compensation adjustments, retention incentives, and hiring approval by the commissioner. The commissioner shall have the full authority to evaluate applicants for employment or promotion or make classification determinations for positions within the special merit-based system. The pay rates and employment requirements shall be put into effect on or before January 1, 2024. This special merit-based system shall apply to new employees in the above referenced job classifications and for existing employees who elect, in writing to enter the special merit-based system. The special merit-based system is exempt from the Division of Personnel and any and all requirements of §29-6-1 et seq . of this code and any related rules. (b) Funding for the pay rates and employment requirements shall be provided from the appropriation to the Bureau of Social Services. (c) The commissioner may conduct periodic wage and compensation analysis of identified market rates for the above positions as determined by the commissioner. (d) The commissioner may promulgate emergency rules pursuant to the provisions of §29A-3-15 of this code and shall propose rules for legislative approval, in accordance with the provisions of §29A-3-1 et seq . of this code, to implement and comply with the provisions of this section no later than to be considered during the regular session of the Legislature, 2023.  §49-10-103.  Bureau for Social Service employees no requirement uniformity in pay scale. The Legislature finds that the Bureau for Social Services is having extreme difficulty retaining child protective service workers, youth service workers, adult protective service workers, and other related workers, including necessary casework support personnel and managers at the county level, who assist in the provision of services to vulnerable populations. To retain qualified employees in these crucial positions, there is no requirement for uniformity regarding the pay scale for the same classification between regions of the state to account for market rates and demand for specific positions. The provisions of §6C-2-1 et seq . of this code shall be applicable to the employees of the special merit-based system as set forth in §49-10-102 of this code, however, there is no right to a grievance for any such regional pay disparity for the same job classification.  ARTICLE 11. System reporting.   §49-11-101. Systemic reporting transparency; rulemaking. (a) The commissioner shall amend the existing child welfare data dashboard to report on system-wide issues, including, but not limited to, system-level performance indicators, intake hotline performance indicators, field investigation performance indicators, open case performance indicators, out-of-home placement performance indicators, and federally mandated performance indicators. (b) The commissioner shall propose rules for legislative approval in accordance with the provisions of §29A-3-1 et seq . of this code to be considered during the regular session of the Legislature, 2023. The commissioner may promulgate emergency rules pursuant to the provisions of §29A-3-15 of this code. """,Introduced,Human Services

(b)  The Foster Care Ombudsman shall maintain confidentiality with respect to all matters including the identities of complainants, witnesses, or others from whom information is acquired, except insofar as disclosures may be necessary to enable the Foster Care Ombudsman to carry out duties of the office or to support recommendations.

Each cause or condition set forth in this section is subject to confirmation by the attendance authority of the county. A child who is exempt from compulsory school attendance under this section is not subject to prosecution under §18‑8‑2 of this code, nor is such a child a status offender as defined by §49‑1‑202 of this code. (b) A child is exempt from the compulsory school attendance requirement set forth in § 18‑8‑1a of this code if the requirements of this subsection, relating to instruction in a private, parochial, or other approved school, are met. The instruction shall be in a school approved by the county board and for a time equal to the instructional term set forth in §18‑5‑45 of this code. In all private, parochial, or other schools approved pursuant to this subsection, it is the duty of the principal or other person in control, upon the request of the county superintendent, to furnish to the county board such information and records as may be required with respect to attendance, instruction, and progress of students enrolled. (c) A child is exempt from the compulsory school attendance requirement set forth in §18‑8‑1a of this code if the requirements of either subdivision (1); or subdivision (2) of this subsection, both relating to home instruction, are met  the child: (1) Receives instruction in the home of the child or children or at some other place approved by the county board, for a time equal to the instructional term set forth in §18‑5‑45 of this code, and meets the requirements of §18‑8-1b of this code; or (2) Participates in a learning pod or microschool, pursuant to this subsection and meets the requirements of §18‑8-1c of this code.

If the request for home instruction is denied by the county board, good and reasonable justification for the denial shall be furnished in writing to the applicant by the county board. The instruction shall be conducted by a person or persons who, in the judgment of the county superintendent and county board, are qualified to give instruction in subjects required to be taught in public elementary schools in the state. The person or persons providing the instruction, upon request of the county superintendent, shall furnish to the county board information and records as may be required periodically with respect to attendance, instruction, and progress of students receiving the instruction. The state board shall develop guidelines for the home schooling of special education students including alternative assessment measures to assure that satisfactory academic progress is achieved. (2) The child meets the requirements set forth in this subdivision: Provided , That the county superintendent may, after a showing of probable cause, seek from the circuit court of the county an order denying home instruction of the child. The order may be granted upon a showing of clear and convincing evidence that the child will suffer neglect in his or her education or that there are other compelling reasons to deny home instruction. (A) Upon commencing home instruction under this section the parent of a child receiving home instruction shall present to the county superintendent or county board a notice of intent to provide home instruction that includes the name, address, and age of any child of compulsory school age to be instructed and assurance that the child shall receive instruction in reading, language, mathematics, science, and social studies, and that the child shall be assessed annually in accordance with this subdivision. The person providing home instruction shall notify the county superintendent upon termination of home instruction for a child who is of compulsory attendance age. Upon establishing residence in a new county, the person providing home instruction shall notify the previous county superintendent and submit a new notice of intent to the superintendent of the new county of residence: Provided , That if a child is enrolled in a public school, notice of intent to provide home instruction shall be given on or before the date home instruction is to begin.

The test shall be administered to the child at a public school in the county of residence. Determination of acceptable progress shall be based on current guidelines of the state testing program; (iii) A portfolio of samples of the child’s work is reviewed by a certified teacher who determines whether the child’s academic progress for the year is in accordance with the child’s abilities. The teacher shall provide a written narrative about the child’s progress in the areas of reading, language, mathematics, science, and social studies and shall note any areas which, in the professional opinion of the reviewer, show need for improvement or remediation. If the narrative indicates that the child’s academic progress for the year is in accordance with the child’s abilities, the child is considered to have made acceptable progress; or (iv) The child completes an alternative academic assessment of proficiency that is mutually agreed upon by the parent or legal guardian and the county superintendent. (D) A parent or legal guardian shall maintain copies of each student’s Academic Assessment for three years. When the annual assessment fails to show acceptable progress, the person or persons providing home instruction shall initiate a remedial program to foster acceptable progress. The county board upon request shall notify the parents or legal guardian of the child, in writing, of the services available to assist in the assessment of the child’s eligibility for special education services.

In the event that the child does not achieve acceptable progress for a second consecutive year, the person or persons providing instruction shall submit to the county superintendent additional evidence that appropriate instruction is being provided. (E) The parent or legal guardian shall submit to the county superintendent the results of the academic assessment of the child at grade levels three, five, eight, and 11, as applicable, by June 30 of the year in which the assessment was administered.

(d) A child is exempt from the compulsory school attendance requirement set forth in §18‑8‑1a of this code if the requirements of this subsection, relating to physical or mental incapacity, are met. Physical or mental incapacity consists of incapacity for school attendance and the performance of school work. In all cases of prolonged absence from school due to incapacity of the child to attend, the written statement of a licensed physician or authorized school nurse is required. Incapacity shall be narrowly defined and in any case the provisions of this article may not allow for the exclusion of the mentally, physically, emotionally, or behaviorally handicapped child otherwise entitled to a free appropriate education. (e) A child is exempt from the compulsory school attendance requirement set forth in §18‑8‑1a of this code if conditions rendering school attendance impossible or hazardous to the life, health, or safety of the child exist.

(i) A child is exempt from the compulsory school attendance requirement set forth in §18‑8‑1a of this code if the requirements of this subsection, relating to destitution in the home, are met. Exemption based on a condition of extreme destitution in the home may be granted only upon the written recommendation of the county attendance director to the county superintendent following careful investigation of the case. A copy of the report confirming the condition and school exemption shall be placed with the county director of public assistance. This enactment contemplates every reasonable effort that may properly be taken on the part of both school and public assistance authorities for the relief of home conditions officially recognized as being so destitute as to deprive children of the privilege of school attendance. Exemption for this cause is not allowed when the destitution is relieved through public or private means. (j) A child is exempt from the compulsory school attendance requirement set forth in §18‑8‑1a of this code if the requirements of this subsection, relating to church ordinances and observances of regular church ordinances, are met.

The county superintendent shall enter the following into the West Virginia Education Information System (WVEIS): (1) The filing of the notice of intent pursuant to this subsection; (2)  In the case of a Hope Scholarship recipient who chooses an individualized instructional program, annually, the child’s test results or determination that a student is making academic progress commensurate with his or her age and ability, as applicable, pursuant to §18‑31‑8(a)(4) of this code; and (3) In the case of an eligible recipient enrolling in a participating school, annually, the filing of a notice of enrollment pursuant to §18‑31‑11(a)(6) of this code. (n) A child is exempt from the compulsory school attendance requirement set forth in §18‑8‑1a of this code if the child participates in a learning pod or microschool, pursuant to this subsection. (1) For the purposes of this subsection: (A) “Learning pod” means a voluntary association of parents choosing to group their children together to participate in their elementary or secondary academic studies as an alternative to enrolling in a public school, private school, homeschool, or microschool, including participation in an activity or service provided to the children in exchange for payment; and (B) “Microschool” means a school initiated by one or more teachers or an entity created to operate a school that charges tuition for the students who enroll and is an alternative to enrolling in a public school, private school, homeschool, or learning pod.

The person providing instruction shall notify the county superintendent upon termination of participation in a learning pod or microschool for a child who is of compulsory attendance age. Upon establishing residence in a new county, the person providing instruction shall notify the previous county superintendent and submit a new notice of intent to the superintendent of the new county of residence: Provided , That if a child is enrolled in a public school, notice of intent to participate in a learning pod or microschool shall be given on or before the date participation is to begin. (3) The person or persons providing instruction shall submit satisfactory evidence of a high school diploma or equivalent, or a post‑secondary degree or certificate from a regionally accredited institution, or from an institution of higher education that has been authorized to confer a post‑secondary degree or certificate in West Virginia by the West Virginia Council for Community and Technical College Education or by the West Virginia Higher Education Policy Commission. (4) Annually, the person or persons providing instruction shall obtain an academic assessment of the child for the previous school year in one of the following ways: (A) The child participating in a learning pod or microschool takes a nationally normed standardized achievement test published or normed not more than 10 years from the date of administration and administered under the conditions as set forth by the published instructions of the selected test and by a person qualified in accordance with the test’s published guidelines in the subjects of reading, language, mathematics, science, and social studies.

The test shall be administered to the child at a public school in the county of residence. Determination of acceptable progress shall be based on current guidelines of the state testing program; (C) A portfolio of samples of the child’s work is reviewed by a certified teacher who determines whether the child’s academic progress for the year is in accordance with the child’s abilities. The teacher shall provide a written narrative about the child’s progress in the areas of reading, language, mathematics, science, and social studies and shall note any areas which, in the professional opinion of the reviewer, show need for improvement or remediation. If the narrative indicates that the child’s academic progress for the year is in accordance with the child’s abilities, the child is considered to have made acceptable progress; or (D) The child completes an alternative academic assessment of proficiency that is mutually agreed upon by the parent or legal guardian and the county superintendent. (5) A parent or legal guardian shall maintain copies of each student’s Academic Assessment for three years. When the annual assessment fails to show acceptable progress, the person or persons providing instruction shall initiate a remedial program to foster acceptable progress. The county board upon request shall notify the parents or legal guardian of the child, in writing, of the services available to assist in the assessment of the child’s eligibility for special education services.

(7) The county superintendent or a designee shall offer such assistance, including textbooks, other teaching materials and available resources, all subject to availability, as may assist the person or persons providing instruction. Any child participating in a learning pod or microschool may upon approval of the county board exercise the option to attend any class offered by the county board as the person or persons providing instruction may consider appropriate subject to normal registration and attendance requirements. (8) No learning pod or microschool which meets the requirements of this subsection is subject to any other provision of law relating to education: Provided , That any learning pod or microschool which has a student requiring special education instruction must comply with the provisions of §18‑20‑11 of this code, including, but not limited to, placement of video cameras for the protection of that exceptional student.

(a) A child receiving home instruction pursuant to the exemption from compulsory school attendance set forth in §18‑8‑1(c) of this code, must meet the following requirements: (1) The instruction shall be in the home of the child or children or at some other place approved by the county board and for a time equal to the instructional term set forth in §18-5-45 of this code.

Be it enacted by the Legislature of West Virginia:  ARTICLE 5. VITAL STATISTICS.  §16-5-10. Birth registration acknowledgment and rescission of paternity. (a) A certificate of birth for each live birth which occurs in this state shall be filed with the section of vital statistics, or as otherwise directed by the State Registrar, within seven days after the birth and shall be registered if it has been completed and filed in accordance with this section. (b) When a birth occurs in transit to or in an institution, the person in charge of the institution or his or her authorized designee shall obtain all data required by the certificate, prepare the certificate, certify either by signature or by an approved electronic process that the child was born alive at the place and time and on the date stated, and file the certificate as directed in subsection (a) of this section. The physician or other person in attendance, or any person providing prenatal care shall provide the medical information required by the certificate within 72 hours after the birth. (c) When a birth occurs other than in transit to or in an institution, the certificate shall be prepared and filed by one of the following persons in the indicated order of priority in accordance with legislative rule: (1) The physician in attendance at or immediately after the birth; (2) Any other person in attendance at or immediately after the birth; (3) The father or the mother, or, in the absence of the father and the inability of the mother, the person in charge of the premises where the birth occurred; or (4) Any other person qualified by the department by rule to establish the facts of birth. (d) When a birth occurs on a moving conveyance within the United States and the child is first removed from the conveyance in this state, the birth shall be registered in this state, and the place where it is first removed shall be considered the place of birth. When a birth occurs on a moving conveyance while in international waters or air space or in a foreign country or its air space and the child is first removed from the conveyance in this state, the birth shall be registered in this state, but the certificate shall show the actual place of birth insofar as can be determined. (e) For the purposes of birth registration, the woman who gives birth to the child is presumed to be the mother, unless otherwise specifically provided by state law or determined by a court of competent jurisdiction prior to the filing of the certificate of birth. (f) If  (1) Except as set forth in paragraphs (A) through (G) of this subsection, if the mother was married at the time of either conception or birth, or between conception and birth, the name of the most recent husband shall be entered on the certificate as the father of the child, unless : To codify the long-held West Virginia common law precedent recognizing the long-standing tradition and social convention that a child’s surname follows that of their father, and that fathers who express an intention to maintain a relationship with and support for their child have a protectable interest in their child bearing the father’s surname, the surname of the most recent husband shall be entered as the child’s surname, unless: (A) The father has abandoned the mother and has made no expression of interest in the child or in the child having the father’s surname; and (i) The mother has made good faith efforts to ascertain the father’s wishes concerning the child’s surname; and (ii) There is no founded risk to the mother’s physical safety that communicating with father would pose: Provided, That any founded such risk made by the mother, as supported by evidence determined by court after an adversarial hearing on the record at which both parties have the right to present witnesses and evidence, is grounds for dispensing with the requirement that the mother make good faith efforts to ascertain the father’s wishes concerning the child’s surname: Provided, however , That the mother may not unilaterally cut off communication with the child’s father concerning the surnaming of the child, nor prevent the father and any siblings or half-siblings of the child from being present at the birth, nor may the mother unilaterally attempt to give the child a surname other than that of the father, except as set forth in this subdivision: Provided further , That any attempt by the mother to unilaterally refuse to discuss the surnaming of the child with the father, to preclude father and siblings or half-siblings from being present at the birth, or to unilaterally give the child a different surname, is prima facie evidence of the mother’s intent to alienate the father from his child, and the father may petition the court that such behavior by the mother, in the absence of founded risk to her physical safety, to be limiting factors in future custody and parenting time allocations as set forth in §48-9-206(A)(9) and §48-9-209(a)(4) of this code. Any alternate surnaming of the child resulting therefrom may not be relied upon for a finding by any court that the child maintaining the alternate surname is in the best interests of the child. (iii) Any father whose child has been given a surname other than the father’s where the mother has engaged in alienating acts as set forth in this subdivision has a right to petition to change the child’s surname, regardless of prior denial of any name change petition, pursuant to the Genealogical Record Integrity Act of 2023: Provided, That the father is not disqualified by the exceptions set forth in this subdivision; (B) Both mother and father expressly agree in notarized writing that the child shall bear a surname different from that of the legal father; (C) The child is the result of conception caused by rape; (D) There has been shown by clear and convincing evidence determined by a court after an adversarial hearing on the record at which both parties have the right to present witnesses and evidence, that the use of the father’s surname would cause a risk of ongoing public scandal to, or ostracization of, the child due to notoriety of the father’s surname for reasons of some grave public matter related to father; (1)  (E) Paternity has been determined otherwise by a court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to the provisions of §48-24-101 et seq. of this code or other applicable law, in which case the name of the father as determined by the court shall be entered on the certificate; or (2)  (F) Genetic testing shows that the alleged father is the biological father of the child pursuant to the following guidelines: (A)  (i) The tests show that the inherited characteristics including, but not limited to, blood types, have been determined by appropriate testing procedures at a hospital, independent medical institution or independent medical laboratory duly licensed under the laws of this state, or any other state, and an expert qualified as an examiner of genetic markers has analyzed, interpreted and reported on the results; and (B)  (ii) The blood or tissue or other genetic test results show a statistical probability of paternity of more than 98 percent; or (3)  (G) The mother, her husband, and an alleged father acknowledge that the husband is not the biological father and that the alleged father is the true biological father: Provided, That the conditions set forth in paragraphs (A) through (D  (i) through (iv) of this paragraph are met: (A)  (i) The mother executes an affidavit of nonpaternity attesting that her husband is not the biological father of the child and that another man is the biological father; and (B)  (ii) The man named as the alleged biological father executes an affidavit of paternity attesting that he or she is the biological father; and (C)  (iii) The husband executes an affidavit of nonpaternity attesting that he or she is not the biological father; and (D)  (iv) Affidavits executed pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision may be joint or individual or a combination thereof, and each signature shall be individually notarized.

(4)  (2) If the affidavits are executed as specified in subdivision (3)  paragraph (G) of this section  subdivision or genetic tests as specified in subdivision (2)  paragraph (F) of this section  subdivision verify that the alleged father is the biological father, the alleged father shall be shown as the father on the certificate of live birth. Paternity established pursuant to subdivision (2) or (3)  paragraph (F) or (G) of this section  subdivision establishes the father for all legal purposes including, but not limited to, the establishment and enforcement of child support orders, and may be rescinded only by court order upon a showing of fraud, duress or material mistake of fact. (5)  (3) Paternity may be established pursuant to subdivision (2) or (3)  paragraph (F) or (G)  subdivision (2) of this section  subsection only when the husband’s name does not appear as the father of a child on a registered and filed certificate of live birth and the affidavits or genetic tests are completed and submitted to the section of vital statistics within one year of the date of birth of the child.

The affidavit may be joint or individual and each signature shall be individually notarized.

(1) The notarized affidavit of paternity shall include filing instructions, the parties’ Social Security number and addresses and a statement that parties were given notice of the alternatives to, the legal consequences of, and the rights and obligations of acknowledging paternity, including, but not limited to, the duty to support a child. If either of the parents is a minor, the statement shall include an explanation of any rights that may be afforded due to the minority status. An unmarried father’s assumption of such rights and obligations of acknowledging paternity by notarized affidavit entitles the unmarried father to the same protectable interest in his child or children bearing the father’s surname, and subject to the same applicable conditions and exceptions, set forth in subdivision (1), subsection (f) of this section. (2) The failure or refusal to include all information required by subdivision (1) of this subsection shall  does not affect the validity of the affidavit of paternity, in the absence of a finding by a court of competent jurisdiction that it was obtained by fraud, duress or material mistake of fact, as provided in subdivision (4) of this subsection.

Any child receiving home instruction may upon approval of the county board exercise the option to attend any class offered by the county board as the person or persons providing home instruction may consider appropriate subject to normal registration and attendance requirements (d) A child is exempt from the compulsory school attendance requirement set forth in §18-8-1a of this code if the requirements of this subsection, relating to physical or mental incapacity, are met. Physical or mental incapacity consists of incapacity for school attendance and the performance of school work. In all cases of prolonged absence from school due to incapacity of the child to attend, the written statement of a licensed physician or authorized school nurse is required. Incapacity shall be narrowly defined and in any case the provisions of this article may not allow for the exclusion of the mentally, physically, emotionally, or behaviorally handicapped child otherwise entitled to a free appropriate education. (e) A child is exempt from the compulsory school attendance requirement set forth in §18-8-1a of this code if conditions rendering school attendance impossible or hazardous to the life, health, or safety of the child exist.

Exemption for this cause is not allowed when the destitution is relieved through public or private means. (j) A child is exempt from the compulsory school attendance requirement set forth in §18-8-1a of this code if the requirements of this subsection, relating to church ordinances and observances of regular church ordinances, are met.

Be it enacted by the Legislature of West Virginia:  article 4. Court actions.  §49-4-114. Consent by agency or department to adoption of child; statement of relinquishment by parent; counseling services; petition to terminate parental rights; notice; hearing; court orders. (a)(1) Whenever a child welfare agency licensed to place children for adoption or the Department of Health and Human Resources has been given the permanent legal and physical custody of any child and the rights of the mother and the rights of the legal, determined, putative, outside or unknown father of the child have been terminated by order of a court of competent jurisdiction or by a legally executed relinquishment of parental rights, the child welfare agency or the department may consent to the adoption of the child pursuant to article twenty-two, chapter forty-eight of this code. (2) Relinquishment for an adoption to an agency or to the department is required of the same persons whose consent or relinquishment is required under section three hundred one, article twenty-two, chapter forty-eight of this code. The form of any relinquishment so required shall conform as nearly as practicable to the requirements established in section three hundred three, article twenty-two, chapter forty-eight, and all other provisions of that article providing for relinquishment for adoption shall govern the proceedings herein. (3) For purposes of any placement of a child for adoption by the department, the department shall first consider the suitability and willingness of any known grandparent or grandparents to adopt the child. Once grandparents who are interested in adopting the child have been identified, the department shall conduct a home study evaluation, including home visits and individual interviews by a licensed social worker. If the department determines, based on the home study evaluation, that the grandparents would be suitable adoptive parents, it shall assure that the grandparents are offered the placement of the child prior to the consideration of any other prospective adoptive parents. A circuit court judge may determine that an adoption placement is in the best interests of the child without a home study or without the placement having passed the home study. (4) The department shall make available, upon request, for purposes of any private or agency adoption proceeding, preplacement and post-placement counseling services by persons experienced in adoption counseling, at no cost, to any person whose consent or relinquishment is required pursuant to article twenty-two, chapter forty-eight of this code. (b)(1) Whenever the mother has executed a relinquishment pursuant to this section, and the legal, determined, putative, outsider or unknown father, as those terms are defined pursuant to part one, article twenty-two, chapter forty-eight of this code, has not executed a relinquishment, the child welfare agency or the department may, by verified petition, seek to have the father's rights terminated based upon the grounds of abandonment or neglect of the child. Abandonment may be established in accordance with section three hundred six, article twenty-two, chapter forty-eight of this code. (2) Unless waived by a writing acknowledged as in the case of deeds or by other proper means, notice of the petition shall be served on any person entitled to parental rights of a child prior to its adoption who has not signed a relinquishment of custody of the child. (3) In addition, notice shall be given to any putative, outsider or unknown father who has asserted or exercised parental rights and duties to and with the child and who has not relinquished any parental rights and the rights have not otherwise been terminated, or who has not had reasonable opportunity before or after the birth of the child to assert or exercise those rights, except that if the child is more than six months old at the time the notice would be required and the father has not asserted or exercised his or her parental rights and he or she knew the whereabouts of the child, then the father shall be presumed to have had reasonable opportunity to assert or exercise any rights. (c)(1) Upon the filing of the verified petition seeking to have the parental rights terminated, the court shall set a hearing on the petition. A copy of the petition and notice of the date, time and place of the hearing on the petition shall be personally served on any respondent at least twenty days prior to the date set for the hearing. (2) The notice shall inform the person that his or her parental rights, if any, may be terminated in the proceeding and that the person may appear and defend any rights within twenty days of the service. In the case of a person who is a nonresident or whose whereabouts are unknown, service shall be achieved: (1) By personal service; (2) by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, to the person's last known address, with instructions to forward; or (3) by publication. If personal service is not acquired, then if the person giving notice has any knowledge of the whereabouts of the person to be served, including a last known address, service by mail shall be first attempted as herein provided. Service achieved by mail shall be complete upon mailing and is sufficient service without the need for notice by publication. In the event that no return receipt is received giving adequate evidence of receipt of the notice by the addressee or of receipt of the notice at the address to which the notice was mailed or forwarded, or if the whereabouts of the person are unknown, then the person required to give notice shall file with the court an affidavit setting forth the circumstances of any attempt to serve the notice by mail, and the diligent efforts to ascertain the whereabouts of the person to be served. If the court determines that the whereabouts of the person to be served cannot be ascertained and that due diligence has been exercised to ascertain the person's whereabouts, then the court shall order service of the notice by publication as a Class II publication in compliance with article three, chapter fifty-nine of this code, and the publication area shall be the county where the proceedings are had, and in the county where the person to be served was last known to reside. In the case of a person under disability, service shall be made on the person and his or her personal representative, or if there be none, on a guardian ad litem. (3) In the case of service by publication or mail or service on a personal representative or a guardian ad litem, the person is allowed thirty days from the date of the first publication or mailing of the service on a personal representative or guardian ad litem in which to appear and defend the parental rights. (d) A petition under this section may be instituted in the county where the child resides or where the child is living. (e) If the court finds that the person certified to parental rights is guilty of the allegations set forth in the petition, the court shall enter an order terminating his or her parental rights and shall award the legal and physical custody and control of the child to the petitioner.  NOTE: The purpose of this bill is to clarify that circuit court judges may place a child in a home without a home study or without a passed home study if the judge determines that this is in the best interests of the child.

(E) If the complaint was filed more than sixty days from the date of execution of the affidavit of paternity or the date of an administrative or judicial proceeding relating to the child in which the signatory of the affidavit of paternity is a party, the court may set aside the acknowledgment only upon a finding, by clear and convincing evidence, that the affidavit of paternity was executed under circumstances of fraud, duress or material mistake of fact. (F) The circuit clerk shall forward a copy of any order entered pursuant to this proceeding to the state Registrar by certified mail. The order shall state all changes to be made, if any, to the certificate of birth. The certificate of birth may not be marked ""Amended.""

Preliminary analysis of breath to determine alcoholic content of blood. When a law-enforcement officer has reason to believe a person has committed an offense prohibited by section two of this article  §17C-5-2 of this code or by an ordinance of a municipality of this state which has the same elements as an offense described in said section two of this article  §17C-5-2 of this code, the law-enforcement officer may require such person to submit to a preliminary breath analysis for the purpose of determining such person's blood alcohol content. Such breath analysis must be administered as soon as possible after the law-enforcement officer has a reasonable belief that the person has been driving while under the influence of alcohol, controlled substances or drugs. Any preliminary breath analysis required under this section must be administered with a device and in a manner approved by the department of health  West Virginia State Police Forensic Laboratory for that purpose.

(a) A preliminary breath analysis may be administered to a child whenever a law-enforcement official has reasonable cause to believe the child to have been driving a motor vehicle with any amount of alcohol in his or her blood for the purpose of determining the child’s blood alcohol content. The breath analysis must be administered as soon as possible after the law-enforcement officer arrives at a reasonable belief that the child has been driving a motor vehicle with any amount of alcohol in his or her blood. Any preliminary breath analysis administered pursuant to this subsection must be administered with a device and in a manner approved by the division of health  West Virginia State Police Forensic Laboratory for that purpose. If a preliminary breath analysis is administered, the results shall be used solely for the purpose of guiding the officer in deciding whether the child, at the time of driving the motor vehicle, had an alcohol concentration in his or her blood of .0002  .02 of one percent or more, by weight, and should, therefore, be taken into custody to administer a secondary test in accordance with the provisions of this section. (b) A child may be taken into custody by a law-enforcement official without a warrant or court order if the official has reasonable grounds to believe the child to have been driving a motor vehicle with any amount of alcohol in his or her blood. If a preliminary breath analysis is administered and the results of the analysis indicate that the child has an alcohol concentration in his or her blood of less than .0002  .02 of one percent, by weight, the child may not be taken into custody unless other grounds exist under §49-4-705(b) of this code. Upon taking a child into custody pursuant to the provisions of this section, the official shall take all reasonable steps to cause notification to be made to the child’s parent or custodian or, if the parent or custodian cannot be located, to a close relative. (c) Upon taking a child into custody pursuant to this section, the official shall take the child to a facility where a secondary test of the child’s blood or urine may be administered at the direction of the official or a test of the child’s breath may be administered by the official. The law-enforcement agency by which such law-enforcement official is employed shall designate whether the secondary test is a test of either blood breath, or urine  or breath : Provided , That if the test is a blood test and the child refuses to submit to the blood test, then the law-enforcement official taking the child into custody shall designate in lieu thereof a breath test to be administered. Notwithstanding the provisions of §17C-5-7  §17C-5-7a of this code, a refusal to submit to a blood test only shall not result in the revocation of the child’s license to operate a motor vehicle in this state. Any child taken into custody pursuant to this section shall be given a written statement advising him or her that a refusal to submit to a secondary test of either blood breath, or urine  or breath , as finally designated by the law-enforcement agency or official in accordance with this subsection, will result in the suspension of his or her license to operate a motor vehicle in this state for a period of at least 30 days or a revocation of the license for a period up to life. (d) If the law-enforcement official taking the child into custody is employed by a law-enforcement agency which does not have available the testing equipment or facilities necessary to conduct any secondary breath test which may be administered pursuant to the provisions of this section, then the official who took the child into custody may request another qualified person to administer a secondary breath test: Provided , That the breath test shall be administered in the presence of the official who took the child into custody. The results of the breath test may be used in evidence to the same extent and in the same manner as if the test had been conducted by the law-enforcement official who took the child into custody. The qualified person administering the breath test must be a member of the West Virginia state police  State Police, the sheriff of the county where the child was taken into custody, or any deputy of the sheriff or a law-enforcement official of another municipality within the county wherein the child was taken into custody. Only the person actually administering the secondary breath test is competent to testify as to the results and the veracity of the test. If the secondary test is a blood test, the test shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of §17C-5-6 of this code. (e) After taking the child into custody, if the law-enforcement official has reasonable cause to believe that the act of the child in driving the motor vehicle is such that it would provide grounds for arrest for an offense defined under the provisions of §17C-5-2 of this code if the child were an adult, then the official shall proceed to treat the child in the same manner as any other child taken into custody without a warrant or court order, in accordance with the provisions of §17C-5-8 of this code. (f) If the results of any secondary test administered pursuant to this section indicate that the child, at the time of driving the motor vehicle, had an alcohol concentration in his or her blood of .0008  .08 of one percent or less, by weight, and if the law-enforcement official does not have reasonable cause to believe that the act of the child in driving the motor vehicle is such that it would provide grounds for arrest for an offense defined under the provisions of §17C-5-2 of this code if the child were an adult, then the official shall release the child: Provided , That if the results of any secondary test administered pursuant to this section indicate that the child, at the time of driving the motor vehicle, had an alcohol concentration in his or her blood of .0002  .02 of one percent or more, by weight, the child shall only be released to a parent or custodian, or to some other responsible adult.  §17C-5-8.

(e) A family court is a court of limited jurisdiction. A family court is a court of record only for the purpose of exercising jurisdiction in the matters for which the jurisdiction of the family court is specifically authorized in this section and in chapter 48 of this code. A family court may not exercise the powers given courts of record in §51-5-1 of this code or exercise any other powers provided for courts of record in this code unless specifically authorized by the Legislature. A family court judge is not a “judge of any court of record” or a “judge of a court of record” as the terms are defined and used in §51-9-1 et seq . of this code.  NOTE: The purpose of this bill is to provide a simple proceeding in family court to name a kinship legal guardianship where a person is unmarried and at least 16 years of age or older, and receives effectively no substantial care and support from his or her legal parents, but does receive such care and support from another person who petitions to be named a kinship legal guardian. The bill would clarify who provides substantial care and support for the supported person in the absence of such care and support by the parents. This clarification of support would not affect rights of the legal parents or the rights of the supported person.

1652632,Requiring parents or guardians to participate in programs for juveniles in an out-of-home placement,"""WEST virginia legislature 2023 regular session Committee Substitute for House Bill Number 2150 By Delegate McGeehan [Originating in the Committee on the Judiciary; Reported on February 13, 2023] A BILL to amend and reenact §49-4-712 of the Code of West Virginia, 1931, as amended; and to amend said code by adding thereto a new section, designated §49-4-712a, all relating to requiring parents or guardians to participate in programs for juveniles in an out-of-home placement. Be it enacted by the Legislature of West Virginia:  ARTICLE 4. COURT ACTIONS.  §49-4-712. Intervention and services by the department pursuant to initial disposition for status offenders; enforcement; further disposition; detention; out-of-home placement; department custody; least restrictive alternative; appeal; prohibiting placement of status offenders in a Division of Juvenile Services facility on or after January 1, 2016. (a) The services provided by the department for juveniles adjudicated as status offenders shall be consistent with §49 -2- 1001 et seq. of this code and shall be designed to develop skills and supports within families and to resolve problems related to the juveniles or conflicts within their families. Services may include, but are not limited to, referral of juveniles and parents, guardians or custodians and other family members to services for psychiatric or other medical care, or psychological, welfare, legal, educational or other social services, as appropriate to the needs of the juvenile and his or her family. Services shall include programs that require the participation of a parent or guardian for the reasons set out in the legislative findings in §49-4-712a of this code unless there is a finding by the court that participation by a parent or guardian is not in the best interest of the juvenile. (b) If the juvenile, or his or her parent, guardian or custodian, fails to comply with the services provided in subsection (a) of this section, the department may petition the circuit court: (1) For a valid court order, as defined in §49-1-207 of this code, to enforce compliance with a service plan or to restrain actions that interfere with or defeat a service plan, including a mandate that parents or guardians participate in programs for juveniles in an out-of-home placement for the reasons set out in the legislative findings in §49-4-712a of this code; or (2) For a valid court order to place a juvenile out of home in a nonsecure or staff-secure setting, and/or to place a juvenile in custody of the department: Provided, That a juvenile adjudicated as a status offender may not be placed in an out-of-home placement, excluding placements made for abuse and neglect, if that juvenile has had no prior adjudications for a status or delinquency offense, or no prior disposition to a pre-adjudicatory improvement period or probation for the current matter: Provided, however, That if the court finds  by clear and convincing evidence the existence of a significant and likely risk of harm to the juvenile, a family member or the public and continued placement in the home is contrary to the best interests of the juvenile, such juvenile may be ordered to an out-of-home placement: Provided further, That the court finds the department has made all reasonable efforts to prevent removal of the juvenile from his or her home, or that such reasonable efforts are not required due to an emergent situation. (c) In ordering any further disposition under this section, the court, is not limited to, the relief sought in the department’s petition and shall make reasonable efforts to prevent removal of the juvenile from his or her home or, as an alternative, to place the juvenile in a community-based facility which is the least restrictive alternative appropriate to the needs of the juvenile and the community. The disposition may include reasonable and relevant orders to the parents, guardians or custodians of the juvenile as is necessary and proper to effectuate the disposition. (d) (1) If the court finds that placement in a residential facility is necessary to provide the services under subsection (a) of this section, except as prohibited by subdivision (2), subsection (b) of this section, the court shall make findings of fact as to the necessity of this placement, stated on the record or reduced to writing and filed with the record or incorporated into the order of the court. (2) The findings of fact shall include the factors that indicate: (A) The likely effectiveness of placement in a residential facility for the juvenile; and (B) The community services which were previously attempted. (e) The disposition of the juvenile may not be affected by the fact that the juvenile demanded a trial by jury or made a plea of not guilty. Any order providing disposition other than mandatory referral to the department for services is subject to appeal to the Supreme Court of Appeals. (f) Following any further disposition by the court, the court shall inquire of the juvenile whether or not appeal is desired and the response shall be transcribed; a negative response may not be construed as a waiver. The evidence shall be transcribed as soon as practicable and made available to the juvenile or his or her counsel, if it is requested for purposes of further proceedings. A judge may grant a stay of execution pending further proceedings. (g) A juvenile adjudicated solely as a status offender on or after January 1, 2016, may not be placed in a Division of Juvenile Services facility  §49-4-712a. Parents mandated to participate in outside the home treatment programs. (a) Legislative findings . – The Legislature finds that according to the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources there are currently more than 7000 children in foster care in this state, and thousands more receiving services in long-term, out-of-home residential treatment centers for the treatment of substance abuse, disruptive behavior, and mental or emotional difficulties. Compelling parents to participate in treatment with children who have been placed outside of the home for the treatment of substance abuse, disruptive behavior, and mental or emotional difficulties will aid in improving the effectiveness of services, shortening the length of stay in out-of-home environments, and providing a more effective and less expensive approach to treatment of children in care. The Legislature recognizes the problems of substance abuse, emotional disturbance, and discordant behavior in children and adolescents as the by-product of mental health disorder that has long been treated by focusing on the child alone. If these problems are defined and recognized as a conflict within a child’s environment considerably more options for interventions to help solve and resolve these issues present themselves. Environmental contributions to childhood difficulties are often overlooked, including the absence of effective parenting practices that are frequently directly related to the presence of those difficulties. However, current procedures are to treat the child who is expressing the problem without conducting any intervention with the other people involved in the child’s life. The Legislature further finds that children who have been labeled as troubled in their home, community, and school system, frequently become less troubled once removed from the environment that directly contributes to their difficulties with success. When the child is returned to the home environment without any intervention occurring within that environment, the end result often remains the same; and there is a recreation of the behaviors that have previously been defined as troubled. West Virginia is challenged by a lack of adequate foster placements for children, a lack of adequate in-home services, a lack of an adequate workforce to create improvements in either, in addition to a lack of parent involvement in treatment services for children. If family involvement in treatment can begin as soon as the child is placed in an out-of-home setting, the opportunity for success in treatment will increase dramatically. The Legislature further finds that it is paramount to begin to include families in the treatment of children who suffer from substance addiction, emotional disturbance, and behavior difficulties. Given societal preference in defining these problems as the sole responsibility of the child, families are content to allow the child to undergo treatment independently and are opposed to participating in treatment concurrently with the child. When this occurs, the only improvement occurs solely with the child and parents remain ill prepared to manage the child or the troubling behaviors. Family involvement in the treatment process is a vital component for children receiving out-of-home care. Parental and family involvement leads to more positive outcomes, shorter lengths of stay, more rapid reunification, and less frequent needs for additional out-of-home placements. If behavioral change and reintegration into the family is the goal of treatment, family involvement and participation in treatment are necessary. Involvement by the family members can assist the child by reducing anxiety, aiding in the attachment and bonding of the child with family members, and validating and understanding the child’s trauma, stressors, or deficits which have resulted in involvement with system. Family involvement allows families to know and understand the treatment the child is receiving, which will increase their ability to aid in the decision-making process of their child’s treatment. Family involvement in treatment also enables service providers to educate parents about the importance of continuing treatment once reunification is achieved. As families gain knowledge about their child, they will be better prepared in managing typical patterns of behavior, providing a solid support system, establishing a healthier bond with the child, and understanding and addressing the causes of addiction, emotional disturbance and discordant behavior. Treatment interventions for children with these issues require the family to serve as critical agents of change for improvement. If families are not compelled to actively engage in treatment, they have historically demonstrated the stance of accepting the child’s journey through the treatment process independently. (b) Subject  to the provisions of §49-4-712a of this code, a parent or guardian shall be required to participate in programs designed for out-of-home placement including family therapy sessions offered by the treatment  provider unless there is a finding by the court that participation by a parents or guardian is not in the best interest of the juvenile.    NOTE: The purpose of this bill is to require parents or guardians to participate in programs for juveniles in an out-of-home placement provided there is not a court finding that said participation is not in the best interest of the juvenile.

ARTICLE 3. LICENSING, FEES AND TAXATION OF INSURERS.  §33-3-14d. Additional fire and casualty insurance premium tax; allocation of proceeds; effective date.  (a)(1) For the purpose of providing additional revenue for municipal policemen’s and firemen’s pension and relief funds and the Teachers Retirement System Reserve Fund and for volunteer and part-volunteer fire companies and departments, there is hereby levied and imposed an additional premium tax equal to one percent of taxable premiums for fire insurance and casualty insurance policies. For purposes of this section, casualty insurance does not include insurance on the life of a debtor pursuant to or in connection with a specific loan or other credit transaction or insurance on a debtor to provide indemnity for payments becoming due on a specific loan or other credit transaction while the debtor is disabled as defined in the policy. (2) All moneys collected from this additional tax shall be received by the commissioner and paid by him or her into a special account in the State Treasury, designated the Municipal Pensions and Protection Fund: Provided , That on or after January 1, 2010, the commissioner shall pay 10 percent of the amount collected to the Teachers Retirement System Reserve Fund created in §18-7A-18 of this code, 25 percent of the amount collected to the Fire Protection Fund created in §33-3-33 of this code for allocation by the Treasurer to volunteer and part-volunteer fire companies and departments and 65 percent of the amount collected to the Municipal Pensions and Protection Fund: Provided, however , That upon notification by the Municipal Pensions Oversight Board pursuant to the provisions of §8-22-18b this code, on or after January 1, 2010, or as soon thereafter as the Municipal Pensions Oversight Board is prepared to receive the funds, 65 percent of the amount collected by the commissioner shall be deposited in the Municipal Pensions Security Fund created in §8-22-18b of this code. The net proceeds of this tax after appropriation thereof by the Legislature is distributed in accordance with the provisions of this section, except for distribution from proceeds pursuant to §8-22-18a(d) of this code. (b)(1) Before August 1 of each year, the treasurer of each municipality in which a municipal policemen’s or firemen’s pension and relief fund is established shall report to the State Treasurer the average monthly number of members who worked at least one hundred hours per month and the average monthly number of retired members of municipal policemen’s or firemen’s pension and relief fund or the Municipal Police Officers and Firefighters Retirement System during the preceding fiscal year: Provided , That beginning in the year 2010 and continuing thereafter, the report shall be made to the oversight board created in §8-22-18a of this code. These reports received by the oversight board shall be provided annually to the State Treasurer by September 1. (2) Before September 1 of each calendar year, the State Treasurer, or the Municipal Pensions Oversight Board, once in operation, shall allocate and authorize for distribution the revenues in the Municipal Pensions and Protection Fund which were collected during the preceding calendar year for the purposes set forth in this section. Before September 1 of each calendar year and after the Municipal Pensions Oversight Board has notified the Treasurer and commissioner pursuant to §8-22-18b of this code, the Municipal Pensions Oversight Board shall allocate and authorize for distribution the revenues in the Municipal Pensions Security Fund which were collected during the preceding calendar year for the purposes set forth in this section. In any year the actuarial report required by §8-22-20 of this code indicates that no actuarial deficiency exists in the municipal policemen’s or firemen’s pension and relief fund and that no pension funding revenue bonds of the building commission of such municipality remain outstanding, no revenues may be allocated from the Municipal Pensions and Protection Fund or the Municipal Pensions Security Fund to that fund. The revenues from the Municipal Pensions and Protection Fund shall then be allocated to all other pension and relief funds which have an actuarial deficiency.  Pension funding revenue bonds include bonds of a municipality’s building commission the net proceeds of which were used to fund either or both of a municipality’s policemen’s or firemen’s pension and relief fund or bonds issued to refinance such bonds. (3) The Municipal Pensions Oversight Board shall annually review the investment performance of each municipal policemen’s or firemen’s pension and relief fund. If the municipal pension and relief fund’s board fails for three consecutive years to comply with the investment provisions established §8-22-22a of this code, the oversight board may require the municipal policemen’s or firemen’s pension and relief fund to invest with the Investment Management Board to continue to receive its allocation of funds from the premium tax. If the municipal pension and relief fund fails to move its investments to the Investment Management Fund within the 18-month drawdown period, provided in §8-22-19(e) of this code, the revenues shall be reallocated to all other municipal policemen’s or firemen’s pension and relief funds that have drawn down one hundred percent of their allocations. (4) The moneys, and the interest earned thereon, in the Municipal Pensions and Protection Fund allocated to volunteer and part-volunteer fire companies and departments shall be allocated and distributed quarterly to the volunteer fire companies and departments. Before each distribution date, the State Fire Marshal shall report to the State Treasurer the names and addresses of all volunteer and part-volunteer fire companies and departments within the state which meet the eligibility requirements established in §8-15-8A of this code. (c)(1) Each municipal pension and relief fund shall have allocated and authorized for distribution a pro rata share of the revenues allocated to municipal policemen’s and firemen’s pension and relief funds based on the corresponding municipality’s average monthly number of police officers and firefighters who worked at least one hundred hours per month during the preceding fiscal year. On and after July 1, 1997, from the growth in any moneys collected pursuant to the tax imposed by this section and interest thereon there shall be allocated and authorized for distribution to each municipal pension and relief fund, a pro rata share of the revenues allocated to municipal policemen’s and firemen’s pension and relief funds based on the corresponding municipality’s average number of police officers and firefighters who worked at least 100 hours per month and average monthly number of retired police officers and firefighters. For the purposes of this subsection, the growth in moneys collected from the tax collected pursuant to this section is determined by subtracting the amount of the tax collected during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1996, from the tax collected during the fiscal year for which the allocation is being made and interest thereon. All moneys received by municipal pension and relief funds under this section may be expended only for those purposes described in sections 16 through 28a, inclusive, article 22, chapter eight of this code. Notwithstanding the foregoing provision of this subdivision, if a municipality has outstanding pension funding revenue bonds and continues to pay the normal cost of its policemen’s and firemen’s pension and relief funds, then the allocable share of revenues to be allocated which would otherwise have been allocated to a municipal policemen’s or firemen’s pension and relief fund shall instead be allocated to the trustee of any outstanding pension funding revenue bonds. (2) Each volunteer fire company or department shall receive an equal share of the revenues allocated for volunteer and part-volunteer fire companies and departments. (3)  (2) In addition to the share allocated and distributed in accordance with subdivision (1) of this subsection, each municipal fire department composed of full-time paid members and volunteers and part-volunteer fire companies and departments shall receive a share equal to the share distributed to volunteer fire companies under subdivision (2) of this subsection reduced by an amount equal to the share multiplied by the ratio of the number of full-time paid fire department members who are also members of a municipal firemen’s pension and relief fund or the Municipal Police Officers and Firefighters Retirement System to the total number of members of the fire department.  If a municipality has outstanding pension funding revenue bonds and continues to pay the normal cost of its policemen’s and firemen’s pension and relief funds, then the share that would otherwise be payable to the municipality’s firemen’s pension and relief fund pursuant to this subsection shall be paid to the trustee of such outstanding pension funding revenue bonds. (d) The allocation and distribution of revenues provided in this section are subject to the provisions of §8-22-20 of this code and §8-15-8a and §8-15-8b of this code. (e) Based upon the findings of an audit by the Treasurer, the Legislature hereby finds and declares that during the period of 1982 through April 27, 2012, allocations from the Municipal Pensions and Protection Fund were miscalculated and errors were made in amounts transferred, resulting in overpayments and underpayments to the relief and pension funds and to the Teachers Retirement System, and that the relief and pension funds and the Teachers Retirement System were not at fault for any of the overpayments and underpayments. The Legislature hereby further finds and declares that any attempt by the Municipal Pension Oversight Board or other entity to recover any of the overpayments would be unjust and create economic hardship for the entities that received overpayments. No entity, including, without limitation, the Municipal Pension Oversight Board, may seek to recover from a relief or pension fund, the Teachers Retirement System or the state any overpayments received from the Municipal Pensions and Protection Fund and the overpayments are not subject to recovery, offset or litigation. Pursuant to the audit by the Treasurer, the amount of $3,631,846.55 is determined owed to specific relief and pension funds through the period of April 27, 2012. The Treasurer is hereby authorized to transfer the amount of $3,631,846.55 from the Unclaimed Property Trust Fund to the Municipal Pensions and Protection Fund, which is hereby reopened for the sole purpose of the transfer and remittances pursuant to this subsection, and to use the amount transferred to remit the amounts due to the pension and relief funds. The payment of $3,631,846.55 to the pension and relief funds is complete satisfaction of any amounts due and no entity, including, without limitation, the Municipal Pension Oversight Board and any pension or relief fund, may seek to recover any further amounts.  §33-3-33.

The payment of $3,631,846.55 to the pension and relief funds is complete satisfaction of any amounts due and no entity, including, without limitation, the Municipal Pension Oversight Board and any pension or relief fund, may seek to recover any further amounts (c) The Municipal Pensions Oversight Board shall annually review the investment performance of each municipal policemen’s or firemen’s pension and relief fund. If a municipal pension and relief fund’s board fails for three consecutive years to comply with the investment provisions established by §8-22-22a of this code, the oversight board may require the municipal policemen’s or firemen’s pension and relief fund to invest with the Investment Management Board to continue to receive its allocation of funds from the premium tax. If the municipal pension and relief fund fails to move its investments to the Investment Management Fund within the 18-month drawdown period, provided in §8-22-19(e) of this code, the revenues shall be reallocated to all other municipal policemen's or firemen's pension and relief funds that have drawn down 100% of their allocations.  §33-3-33.

For the purposes of this subsection, the growth in moneys collected from  earnings the tax collected pursuant to this section is determined by subtracting the amount of the tax collected during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1996, from the tax collected during the fiscal year for which the allocation is being made and interest thereon. All moneys received by municipal pension and relief funds under this section may be expended only for those purposes described in §8-22-16 through §8-22-28a of this code. Notwithstanding the foregoing provision of this subdivision, if a municipality has outstanding pension funding revenue bonds and continues to pay the normal cost of its policemen’s and firemen’s pension and relief funds, then the allocable share of revenues to be allocated which would otherwise have been allocated to a municipal policemen’s or firemen’s pension and relief fund shall instead be allocated to the trustee of any outstanding pension funding revenue bonds.

(e) Based upon the findings of an audit by the Treasurer, the Legislature hereby finds and declares that during the period of 1982 through April 27, 2012, allocations from the Municipal Pensions and Protection Fund were miscalculated and errors were made in amounts transferred, resulting in overpayments and underpayments to the relief and pension funds and to the Teachers Retirement System, and that the relief and pension funds and the Teachers Retirement System were not at fault for any of the overpayments and underpayments. The Legislature hereby further finds and declares that any attempt by the Municipal Pension Oversight Board or other entity to recover any of the overpayments would be unjust and create economic hardship for the entities that received overpayments. No entity, including, without limitation, the Municipal Pension Oversight Board, may seek to recover from a relief or pension fund, the Teachers Retirement System or the state any overpayments received from the Municipal Pensions and Protection Fund and the overpayments are not subject to recovery, offset or litigation. Pursuant to the audit by the Treasurer, the amount of $3,631,846.55 is determined owed to specific relief and pension funds through the period of April 27, 2012. The Treasurer is hereby authorized to transfer the amount of $3,631,846.55 from the Unclaimed Property Trust Fund to the Municipal Pensions and Protection Fund, which is hereby reopened for the sole purpose of the transfer and remittances pursuant to this subsection, and to use the amount transferred to remit the amounts due to the pension and relief funds. The payment of $3,631,846.55 to the pension and relief funds is complete satisfaction of any amounts due and no entity, including, without limitation, the Municipal Pension Oversight Board and any pension or relief fund, may seek to recover any further amounts. (c) The Municipal Pensions Oversight Board shall annually review the investment performance of each municipal policemen’s or firemen’s pension and relief fund. If a municipal pension and relief fund’s board fails for three consecutive years to comply with the investment provisions established by §8-22-22a of this code, the oversight board may require the municipal policemen’s or firemen’s pension and relief fund to invest with the Investment Management Board to continue to receive its allocation of funds from the premium tax. If the municipal pension and relief fund fails to move its investments to the Investment Management Fund within the 18-month drawdown period provided in §8-22-19(e) of this code, the revenues shall be reallocated to all other municipal policemen's or firemen's pension and relief funds that have drawn down 100 percent of their allocations.  §33-3-33.

For the purposes of this subsection, the growth in moneys collected from  earnings the tax collected pursuant to this section is determined by subtracting the amount of the tax collected during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1996, from the tax collected during the fiscal year for which the allocation is being made and interest thereon. All moneys received by municipal pension and relief funds under this section may be expended only for those purposes described in §8-22-16 through §8-22-28a of this code. Notwithstanding the foregoing provision of this subdivision, if a municipality has outstanding pension funding revenue bonds and continues to pay the normal cost of its policemen’s and firemen’s pension and relief funds, then the allocable share of revenues to be allocated which would otherwise have been allocated to a municipal policemen’s or firemen’s pension and relief fund shall instead be allocated to the trustee of any outstanding pension funding revenue bonds.

If a municipality has outstanding pension funding revenue bonds and continues to pay the normal cost of its policemen’s and firemen’s pension and relief funds, then the share that would otherwise be payable to the municipality’s firemen’s pension and relief fund pursuant to this subsection shall be paid to the trustee of such outstanding pension funding revenue bonds.  (d)  (4) The allocation and distribution of revenues provided in this section are subject to the provisions of §8-22-20, §8-15-8a, and §8-15-8b of said chapter  this code . (e) Based upon the findings of an audit by the Treasurer, the Legislature hereby finds and declares that during the period of 1982 through April 27, 2012, allocations from the Municipal Pensions and Protection Fund were miscalculated and errors were made in amounts transferred, resulting in overpayments and underpayments to the relief and pension funds and to the Teachers Retirement System, and that the relief and pension funds and the Teachers Retirement System were not at fault for any of the overpayments and underpayments. The Legislature hereby further finds and declares that any attempt by the Municipal Pension Oversight Board or other entity to recover any of the overpayments would be unjust and create economic hardship for the entities that received overpayments. No entity, including, without limitation, the Municipal Pension Oversight Board, may seek to recover from a relief or pension fund, the Teachers Retirement System or the state any overpayments received from the Municipal Pensions and Protection Fund and the overpayments are not subject to recovery, offset or litigation. Pursuant to the audit by the Treasurer, the amount of $3,631,846.55 is determined owed to specific relief and pension funds through the period of April 27, 2012. The Treasurer is hereby authorized to transfer the amount of $3,631,846.55 from the Unclaimed Property Trust Fund to the Municipal Pensions and Protection Fund, which is hereby reopened for the sole purpose of the transfer and remittances pursuant to this subsection, and to use the amount transferred to remit the amounts due to the pension and relief funds. The payment of $3,631,846.55 to the pension and relief funds is complete satisfaction of any amounts due and no entity, including, without limitation, the Municipal Pension Oversight Board and any pension or relief fund, may seek to recover any further amounts. (c) The Municipal Pensions Oversight Board shall annually review the investment performance of each municipal policemen’s or firemen’s pension and relief fund. If a municipal pension and relief fund’s board fails for three consecutive years to comply with the investment provisions established by §8-22-22a of this code, the oversight board may require the municipal policemen’s or firemen’s pension and relief fund to invest with the Investment Management Board to continue to receive its allocation of funds from the premium tax. If the municipal pension and relief fund fails to move its investments to the Investment Management Fund within the 18-month drawdown period provided in §8-22-19(e) of this code, the revenues shall be reallocated to all other municipal policemen's or firemen's pension and relief funds that have drawn down 100 percent of their allocations.  §33-3-33.

The Legislature hereby further finds and declares that any attempt by the Municipal Pension Oversight Board or other entity to recover any of the overpayments would be unjust and create economic hardship for the entities that received overpayments. No entity, including, without limitation, the Municipal Pension Oversight Board, may seek to recover from a relief or pension fund, the Teachers Retirement System or the state any overpayments received from the Municipal Pensions and Protection Fund and the overpayments are not subject to recovery, offset or litigation.

The Treasurer is hereby authorized to transfer the amount of $3,631,846.55 from the Unclaimed Property Trust Fund to the Municipal Pensions and Protection Fund, which is hereby reopened for the sole purpose of the transfer and remittances pursuant to this subsection, and to use the amount transferred to remit the amounts due to the pension and relief funds. The payment of $3,631,846.55 to the pension and relief funds is complete satisfaction of any amounts due and no entity, including, without limitation, the Municipal Pension Oversight Board and any pension or relief fund, may seek to recover any further amounts. (c) The Municipal Pensions Oversight Board shall annually review the investment performance of each municipal policemen’s or firemen’s pension and relief fund. If a municipal pension and relief fund’s board fails for three consecutive years to comply with the investment provisions established by §8-22-22a of this code, the oversight board may require the municipal policemen’s or firemen’s pension and relief fund to invest with the Investment Management Board to continue to receive its allocation of funds from the premium tax. If the municipal pension and relief fund fails to move its investments to the Investment Management Fund within the 18-month drawdown period provided in §8-22-19(e) of this code, the revenues shall be reallocated to all other municipal policemen's or firemen's pension and relief funds that have drawn down 100 percent of their allocations.  §33-3-33.

If the municipal pension and relief fund's board fails for three consecutive years to comply with the investment provisions established by §8-22-22a of this code, the oversight board may require the municipal policemen's or firemen's pension and relief fund to invest with the Investment Management Board to continue to receive its allocation of funds from the premium tax. If the municipal pension and relief fund fails to move its investments to the Investment Management Fund within the 18-month drawdown period, provided in §8-22-19(e) of this code, the revenues shall be reallocated to all other municipal policemen's or firemen's pension and relief funds that have drawn down one hundred percent of their allocations. (4) The moneys, and the interest earned thereon, in the Municipal Pensions and Protection Fund allocated to volunteer and part-volunteer fire companies and departments shall be allocated and distributed quarterly to the volunteer fire companies and departments. Before each distribution date, the State Fire Marshal shall report to the State Treasurer the names and addresses of all volunteer and part-volunteer fire companies and departments within the state which meet the eligibility requirements established in §8-15-8a of this code. (c)  (1) Each municipal pension and relief fund shall have allocated and authorized for distribution a pro rata share of the revenues allocated to municipal policemen's and firemen's pension and relief funds based on the corresponding municipality's average monthly number of police officers and firefighters who worked at least one hundred hours per month during the preceding fiscal year. On and after July 1, 1997, from  (3) The Municipal Pensions Oversight Board shall allocate and distribute  the growth in any moneys collected pursuant to  a pro rata share of the tax imposed by this section and earnings and interest thereon there shall be allocated and authorized for distribution to each municipal policemen’s or municipal firemen’s pension and relief fund, a pro rata share of the revenues allocated to municipal policemen's and firemen's pension and relief funds based on the corresponding municipality's average number of police officers and firefighters who worked at least 100 hours per month during the preceding fiscal year and average monthly number of retired police officers and firefighters during the preceding fiscal year . For the purposes of this subsection, the growth in moneys collected from  earnings the tax collected pursuant to this section is determined by subtracting the amount of the tax collected during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1996, from the tax collected during the fiscal year for which the allocation is being made and interest thereon. All moneys received by municipal pension and relief funds under this section may be expended only for those purposes described in §8-22-16 through §8-22-28a of this code. Notwithstanding the foregoing provision of this subdivision, if a municipality has outstanding pension funding revenue bonds and continues to pay the normal cost of its policemen’s and firemen’s pension and relief funds, then the allocable share of revenues to be allocated which would otherwise have been allocated to a municipal policemen’s or firemen’s pension and relief fund shall instead be allocated to the trustee of any outstanding pension funding revenue bonds. (2) Each volunteer fire company or department shall receive an equal share of the revenues allocated for volunteer and part-volunteer fire companies and departments. (3) In addition to the share allocated and distributed in accordance with subdivision (1) of this subsection, each municipal fire department composed of full-time paid members and volunteers and part-volunteer fire companies and departments shall receive a share equal to the share distributed to volunteer fire companies under subdivision (2) of this subsection reduced by an amount equal to the share multiplied by the ratio of the number of full-time paid fire department members who are also members of a municipal firemen's pension and relief fund or the Municipal Police Officers and Firefighters Retirement System to the total number of members of the fire department. If a municipality has outstanding pension funding revenue bonds and continues to pay the normal cost of its policemen’s and firemen’s pension and relief funds, then the share that would otherwise be payable to the municipality’s firemen’s pension and relief fund pursuant to this subsection shall be paid to the trustee of such outstanding pension funding revenue bonds. (d)  (4) The allocation and distribution of revenues provided in this section are subject to the provisions of §8-22-20, §8-15-8a, and §8-15-8b of said chapter  this code . (e) Based upon the findings of an audit by the Treasurer, the Legislature hereby finds and declares that during the period of 1982 through April 27, 2012, allocations from the Municipal Pensions and Protection Fund were miscalculated and errors were made in amounts transferred, resulting in overpayments and underpayments to the relief and pension funds and to the Teachers Retirement System, and that the relief and pension funds and the Teachers Retirement System were not at fault for any of the overpayments and underpayments. The Legislature hereby further finds and declares that any attempt by the Municipal Pension Oversight Board or other entity to recover any of the overpayments would be unjust and create economic hardship for the entities that received overpayments. No entity, including, without limitation, the Municipal Pension Oversight Board, may seek to recover from a relief or pension fund, the Teachers Retirement System or the state any overpayments received from the Municipal Pensions and Protection Fund and the overpayments are not subject to recovery, offset or litigation. Pursuant to the audit by the Treasurer, the amount of $3,631,846.55 is determined owed to specific relief and pension funds through the period of April 27, 2012. The Treasurer is hereby authorized to transfer the amount of $3,631,846.55 from the Unclaimed Property Trust Fund to the Municipal Pensions and Protection Fund, which is hereby reopened for the sole purpose of the transfer and remittances pursuant to this subsection, and to use the amount transferred to remit the amounts due to the pension and relief funds. The payment of $3,631,846.55 to the pension and relief funds is complete satisfaction of any amounts due and no entity, including, without limitation, the Municipal Pension Oversight Board and any pension or relief fund, may seek to recover any further amounts. (c) The Municipal Pensions Oversight Board shall annually review the investment performance of each municipal policemen’s or firemen’s pension and relief fund. If a municipal pension and relief fund’s board fails for three consecutive years to comply with the investment provisions established by §8-22-22a of this code, the oversight board may require the municipal policemen’s or firemen’s pension and relief fund to invest with the Investment Management Board to continue to receive its allocation of funds from the premium tax. If the municipal pension and relief fund fails to move its investments to the Investment Management Fund within the 18-month drawdown period provided in §8-22-19(e) of this code, the revenues shall be reallocated to all other municipal policemen's or firemen's pension and relief funds that have drawn down 100 percent of their allocations.  §33-3-33.

Response to emergency; findings and purpose; authorizing Fire Commission to create predetermined alarm assignments for assistance to emergencies; prohibiting knowing dismissal of a req; and rulemaking. (a) In order for fire departments, both volunteer and professional, to fulfill their primary obligation of protecting the lives and property of their citizens, they must respond to the emergency scene in the shortest amount of time possible. Due to West Virginia's rural nature and low-density population, in many instances it is at a disadvantage in accomplishing rapid response times. In addition, some emergencies require the response of multiple fire departments to adequately control a fire or other emergency. (b) Since requests for mutual aid, or backup, from other fire departments are initiated by the department that received the initial contact, there is some discretion by the officer in change regarding backup assistance. As such, the fire department that may be able to respond as backup the most quickly is not always notified. Since any delay in response can increase the severity of the damage on human life and property, the goal of all fire departments should be to respond in the shortest amount of time possible. (c) The Fire Commission shall create a system of predetermined alarm assignments to be utilized by fire departments when requesting assistance for an emergency. The assignments shall be selected based upon which fire department is closest to the emergency, and shall be established in a fixed, organized deployment model. (f) No fire officer, or other person authorized to request assistance from another fire department, shall dismiss an automatic notification to a fire department in order to request another fire departments' assistance to the same emergency. (g) The Fire Commission shall propose rules for legislative approval in accordance with the provisions of §29A-3-1 et seq. of this code in order to effectuate the purposes of this section.  NOTE: The purpose of this bill is to require that the fire commission establish a system of predetermined alarm assignments to assist fire departments with backup assistance based upon distance to an emergency.

Community Health Equity Initiative Demonstration Project.  (a) Legislative Findings. – The Legislature makes the following findings: (1) In West Virginia, statewide, babies in African American families are born with lower birth weights and higher rates of infant mortality than babies born in white families; and further, black children under the age of five years live in poverty at higher rates than for children under five years in white families; and African American families have household income and home ownership rates much lower than for similarly situated white families; (2) The unemployment rate of African Americans recently has been almost twice the unemployment rate for Caucasians and significantly higher in some counties with a greater concentration of African American population; (3) Statistics provided by the state Equal Employment Opportunity Office indicate that the percentage of minority employees among the full-time state government employees under the control of the Department of Administration is approximately the same as the percentage of African Americans in the state’s population as a whole; (4) The West Virginia Advisory Committee to the United States Commission on Civil Rights has found continuing reports of racial discrimination in hiring, tension between law-enforcement officers and African American citizens, and hate crimes and violence against minorities, including reported incidents of harassment of racial and ethnic minorities in schools; (5) West Virginia enjoys both a low juvenile crime rate and one of the nation’s lowest juvenile detention rates, yet the percentage of minority youth in the West Virginia juvenile justice system exceeds the national rate of minority youths in the juvenile justice system; (6) In West Virginia, African Americans make up only 3.6 percent of the general population, but account for one third of the adult prison population, one fifth of the juveniles placed in detention and admitted to correctional facilities, and over one half of the juveniles transferred to adult jurisdiction for major felonies; and (7) There is a great and immediate need for comprehensive data collection and analysis on a multiyear basis and for continuing examination and review of solutions with regard to racial disparities in the areas of civil rights, health, education, housing, social issues, employment, economic development, and criminal and juvenile justice systems. (b) Policy. – Researchers  have established that the social and physical environment, not just genetic makeup and individual behavior, influences health and wellbeing outcomes. Structural determinants of health such as socioeconomic status have serious health consequences. Discrimination is a known risk factor for unhealthy behavior, psychological distress, and high blood pressure. More proximate social determinants of health, such as living conditions in the home and neighborhood, can affect exposure to both environmental and social risk factors for poor health. There are compelling and timely reasons for government, nonprofits, and their partners in the private sector to address social determinants of health through smarter investments in community development by establishing and embedding systems of innovation and establishing a state and local policy advocacy team. It is important that any system of innovation developed to address social determinants of health: (1) Identify community strengths and areas for improvement; (2) Identify and understand the status of community health needs; (3) Define improvement areas to guide the community toward implementing and sustaining policy, systems, and environmental changes around healthy living strategies ( e.g., increased physical activity, improved nutrition, reduced tobacco use, and exposure, and chronic disease management); (4) Assist with prioritizing community needs and consider appropriate allocation of available resources; (5) Allows local stakeholders to work together in a collaborative process to survey their community; (6) Offers suggestions and examples of policy, systems, and environmental change strategies; and (7) Provides feedback to communities as they institute local-level change for healthy living. (c) Authorizing participation. – Effective  July 1, 2023, the Commissioner of the Bureau for Public Health shall establish a Community Health Equity Initiative Demonstration Project, to be continued for a period of four years, to develop a model government program to promote public health and general welfare through comprehensive community development for communities across West Virginia. (1) Purpose. – The purpose of the demonstration project is the development of model community programs which will focus and use existing resources of government agencies and community organizations, whose state or local missions include services for health and human resources, public education and arts, higher education, mental health care, social and economic diversity, housing development, economic and community development, urban renewal, workforce development, and small business development, all intended generally to improve community and individual public health and welfare, in and for communities identified as needing special coordination and delivery of services from those agencies. (2) Objective. – The objective of the demonstration project is to improve public health by addressing child and family poverty, educational limitations, and other social determinants of health and welfare through a comprehensive community development plan. The plan should serve as a model to improve public health and education through comprehensive community development across the state. (3) Eligibility. – Communities are eligible to participate in a demonstration project which have an area of approximately one square mile, and a population of at least 3,000 persons, of whom: (A) 25 percent are minorities; (B) at least 55 percent live in rental housing; and (C) at least 50 percent have an income under $27,000.

Community Health Equity Initiative Demonstration Project.  (a) Legislative Findings. – The Legislature makes the following findings: (1) In West Virginia, statewide, babies in African American families are born with lower birth weights and higher rates of infant mortality than babies born in white families; and further, black children under the age of five years live in poverty at higher rates than for children under five years in white families; and African American families have household income and home ownership rates much lower than for similarly situated white families; (2) The unemployment rate of African Americans recently has been almost twice the unemployment rate for Caucasians and significantly higher in some counties with a greater concentration of African American population; (3) Statistics provided by the state Equal Employment Opportunity Office indicate that the percentage of minority employees among the full-time state government employees under the control of the Department of Administration is approximately the same as the percentage of African Americans in the state’s population as a whole; (4) The West Virginia Advisory Committee to the United States Commission on Civil Rights has found continuing reports of racial discrimination in hiring, tension between law-enforcement officers and African American citizens and hate crimes and violence against minorities, including reported incidents of harassment of racial and ethnic minorities in schools; (5) West Virginia enjoys both a low juvenile crime rate and one of the nation’s lowest juvenile detention rates, yet the percentage of minority youth in the West Virginia juvenile justice system exceeds the national rate of minority youths in the juvenile justice system; (6) In West Virginia, African Americans make up only 3.6 percent of the general population, but account for one third of the adult prison population, one fifth of the juveniles placed in detention and admitted to correctional facilities, and over one half of the juveniles transferred to adult jurisdiction for major felonies; and (7) There is a great and immediate need for comprehensive data collection and analysis on a multiyear basis and for continuing examination and review of solutions with regard to racial disparities in the areas of civil rights, health, education, housing, social issues, employment, economic development, and criminal and juvenile justice systems. (b) Policy. – Researchers  have established that the social and physical environment, not just genetic makeup and individual behavior, influences health and well-being outcomes. Structural determinants of health such as socioeconomic status have serious health consequences. Discrimination is a known risk factor for unhealthy behavior, psychological distress, and high blood pressure. More proximate social determinants of health, such as living conditions in the home and neighborhood, can affect exposure to both environmental and social risk factors for poor health. There are compelling and timely reasons for government, nonprofits, and their partners in the private sector to address social determinants of health through smarter investments in community development by establishing and embedding systems of innovation and establishing a state and local policy advocacy team. It is important that any system of innovation developed to address social determinants of health: (1) Identify community strengths and areas for improvement; (2) Identify and understand the status of community health needs; (3) Define improvement areas to guide the community toward implementing and sustaining policy, systems, and environmental changes around healthy living strategies (e.g., increased physical activity, improved nutrition, reduced tobacco use and exposure, and chronic disease management); (4) Assist with prioritizing community needs and consider appropriate allocation of available resources; (5) Allows local stakeholders to work together in a collaborative process to survey their community; (6) Offers suggestions and examples of policy, systems, and environmental change strategies; and (7) Provides feedback to communities as they institute local-level change for healthy living. (c) Authorizing participation. – Effective  July 1, 2023, the Commissioner of the Bureau for Public Health shall establish a Community Health Equity Initiative Demonstration Project, to be continued for a period of four years, to develop a model government program to promote public health and general welfare through comprehensive community development for communities across West Virginia. (1) Purpose. The purpose of the demonstration project is the development of model community programs which will focus and use existing resources of government agencies and community organizations, whose state or local missions include services for health and human resources, public education and arts, higher education, mental health care, social and economic diversity, housing development, economic and community development, urban renewal, workforce development, and small business development, all intended generally to improve community and individual public health and welfare, in and for communities identified as needing special coordination and delivery of services from those agencies. (2) Objective. The objective of the demonstration project is to improve public health by addressing child and family poverty, educational limitations, and other social determinants of health and welfare through a comprehensive community development plan. The plan should serve as a model to improve public health and education through comprehensive community development across the state. (3) Eligibility. Communities are eligible to participate in a demonstration project which have an area of approximately one square mile, and a population of at least 3,000 persons, of whom: (A) 25 percent are minorities; (B) at least 55 percent live in rental housing; and (C) at least 50 percent have an income under $27,000. (4) Administration. The demonstration project shall be developed and administered by the Commissioner of the Bureau for Public Health’s Minority Health Advisory Team established pursuant to §16-1-22 of this code, and it shall encourage state and local agencies and community groups to work together to coordinate government and community activities for improvement of community and individual public health and welfare, and shall identify new and existing funds, personnel, and other existing resources available for the demonstration project. (5) Resources. A demonstration project may receive funding and other committed resources from government, nonprofit, private sector, and community organizations. The demonstration project shall focus and leverage existing resources, including, but not limited to, education services, planning and development services, social services, housing and urban development services, youth and family services, and other public and private resources intended to benefit the quality of life for the community and people living and working in the target community. (d) Plan. – Any  community desiring to participate in the demonstration project shall submit a plan to the advisory team that provides for the following elements: (1) Community and government participation identifying the agencies of state and local government and nonprofit and private sector organizations to participate in the activities of the project whose resources would be focused and directed to best produce anticipated outcomes for the project and community; (2) Health impact assessment by local participants in collaboration with state and federal health officials and organizations; (3) Review of health impact assessment results; (4) Development of a community action plan with measurable, achievable, realistic, time-phased steps to achieving project objectives; (5) Implementation of the community action plan; and (6) Evaluation of measured outcomes. (e) Selection. – By  a majority vote, the advisory team may select one or more eligible communities from those which submit plans for a demonstration project.

If that level of placement is not available, the insurer shall authorize the next higher level of care. In the event of disagreement, the insurer shall provide full detail of its scoring using the relevant level of care placement criteria and guidelines as specified in subsection (b) of this section to the provider of the service. (d) To ensure the proper use of the criteria described in subsection (b) of this section, every insurer shall do all of the following: (1) Sponsor a formal education program by nonprofit clinical specialty associations to educate the insurer’s staff, including any third parties contracted with the insurer to review claims, conduct utilization reviews, or make medical necessity determinations about the clinical review  criteria.

This assessment shall cover all aspects of utilization review as defined in subdivision (3) of subsection (f) of this article. (6) Run interrater reliability reports about how the clinical guidelines are used in conjunction with the utilization management process and parity compliance activities. (7) Achieve interrater reliability pass rates of at least 90 percent and, if this threshold is not met, immediately provide for the remediation of poor interrater reliability and interrater reliability testing for all new staff before they can conduct utilization review without supervision. (e) This section applies to all health care services and benefits for the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of mental health and substance use disorders covered by an insurance policy, including prescription drugs. (f) This section applies to an insurer that covers hospital, medical, or surgical expenses and conducts utilization review as defined in this section, and any entity or contracting provider that performs utilization review or utilization management functions on an insurer’s behalf.

The civil penalties available to the commissioner pursuant to this section are not exclusive and may be sought and employed in combination with any other  remedies available to the commissioner under this code. (h) An insurer shall not adopt, impose, or enforce terms in its policies or provider agreements, in writing or in operation, that undermine, alter, or conflict with the requirements of this section.  §33-57A-5. Discretionary Clauses Prohibited.

(b) For purposes of this section, the term ""discretionary authority"" means a contract provision that has the effect of conferring discretion on an insurer or other claims administrator determine entitlement to benefits or interpret contract language that, in turn, could lead to a deferential standard of review by a reviewing court. (c) This section does not prohibit an insurer from including a provision in a contract that informs an insured that, as part of its routine operations, the plan applies the terms of its contracts for making decisions, including making determinations regarding eligibility, receipt of benefits and claims, or explaining policies, procedures, and processes, so long as the provision could not give rise to a deferential standard of review by a reviewing court.

1653420,"To acknowledge that the mental health of higher education students is of paramount importance, and due to a variety of issues","""WEST VIRGINIA LEGISLATURE 2023 REGULAR SESSION Introduced House Bill 2182 By Delegate Skaff [Introduced January 11, 2023; Referred to the Committee on Education then Finance] A BILL to amend the Code of West Virginia, 1931, as amended, by adding thereto a new article, designated §18B-21-1, §18B-21-2, §18B-21-3 , §18B-21-4, §18B-21-5, §18B-21-6, §18B-21-7, §18B-21-8, §18B-21-9, and §18B-21-10, all relating to improving the mental health of higher education students; providing legislative findings; defining terms; developing the necessary training, peer support and local assistance collaboration within colleges and universities; directing the West Virginia Higher Education Policy Commission and the Community and Technical College System of West Virginia to collaborate in establishing resources with the responsibility of collecting, analyzing, and disseminating data related to mental health in higher education; and providing funding recommendations. Be it enacted by the Legislature of West Virginia:   article 21. west virginia resilience Act.  §18B-21-1.  Short title and intent. This article shall be known and may be cited as ""The West Virginia Resilience Act"". This Act is intended to address gaps in mental health services on college campuses across West Virginia, including both two-year and four-year institutions, through training, peer support, and community-campus partnerships.  §18B-21-2.  Legislative findings and purpose.  The Legislature finds: (1) That student mental health in higher education is an increasing concern and the COVID-19 pandemic situation has brought this vulnerable population into renewed focus due to its additional negative impacts on higher education, including burnout, lack of motivation and concentration, social anxiety, general anxiety, stress, loss of sleep, eating disorders, and depression. There is an urgent need to develop interventions and preventive strategies to address the mental health of college students; (2) About 75 percent of all mental health conditions start by age 24, with higher rates of diagnosed disorders in college-age students; (3) Students who come from low-income households are more likely to have a mental health condition; (4)  A recent national survey found that one in four college students are treated for or diagnosed with a mental health condition and one in five has considered suicide; (5) Young adults are less likely to receive mental health support than any other age group. College campuses can play a big role in addressing this challenge; (6) College-age students are more accepting of mental health services than the general population, but most struggle accessing them. An overwhelming 96 percent of college students reported they would provide support to peers whom they knew were thinking about suicide; (7) Many students lack knowledge of mental health signs and symptoms and do not know how to help or where to refer their friends for services; (8) Services offered by most college campuses are limited in scope and capacity, with 67 percent of campus counseling center directors saying that their campus psychiatric service capacity is inadequate or does not meet student demand; (9) Combined with a lack of available services, the vast majority of students do not seek out services, and many students who complete a suicide never received on-campus services. Paying for community-based services is an issue for about half of students. Combining insufficient on-campus services with unaffordable community resources leaves students on their own; (10) In order to accomplish the goals related to addressing the ongoing mental health crisis affecting college students, training of students, faculty, and staff is essential; (11) Colleges and universities acknowledge that campus counselors are working longer hours to meet increasing demand during the pandemic. Burnout, compassion fatigue, and increases in depression, anxiety, and substance use are risks for counselors coping with high-stress work environments; (12) Therefore, the purpose of this article is to create an initiative to address this serious and growing problem to mandate our institutions of higher education to establish a support system to help those vulnerable students successfully transition to successful healthy citizens. Because the workforce to fill counselor positions is experiencing critical shortages, prioritizing incentives for the educational development and recruitment of credentialed professionals to treat the college population is necessary.  §18B-21-3. Definitions. For purposes of this article, the following words have the meanings ascribed to them unless the context clearly indicates a different meaning: ""Advisor"" means a staff member who provides academic, professional, and personal support to students. ""Campus security"" means a law-enforcement officer who has completed his or her probationary period and is employed as a security officer or campus police officer by a public college or university. ""Linkage agreement"" means a formal agreement between a public college or university and an off-campus mental health provider or agency. ""Mental health condition"" means a symptom consistent with a mental illness or a diagnosed mental illness. ""Public college or university"" means any public university, college, or community college. ""Recovery model"" means the model developed by the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration that defines the process of recovery and includes the four major dimensions that support a life in recovery, which are health, home, purpose, and community. ""Resident assistant"" means a student who is responsible for supervising and assisting other, typically younger, students who live in the same student housing facility. ""Telehealth"" means the evaluation, diagnosis, or interpretation of electronically transmitted patient-specific data between a remote location and a licensed health care professional that generates interaction or treatment recommendations.  §18B-21-4. Higher Education Mental Health Initiative.  Every public college and university shall: (1) Develop and implement an annual student orientation session aimed at raising awareness about mental health conditions; (2) Assess courses and seminars available to students through their regular academic experiences and implement mental health awareness curricula if opportunities for integration exist; (3) Create and feature a page on its website and mobile application with information dedicated solely to the mental health resources available to students at the public college or university and in the surrounding community; (4) Distribute messages related to mental health resources that encourage help-seeking behavior through the online learning platform of the public college or university during high-stress periods of the academic year, including, but not limited to, midterm or final examinations. These stigma-reducing strategies must be based on documented best practices; (5) Two years after the effective date of this article, implement an online screening tool to raise awareness and establish a mechanism to link or refer students of the public college or university to services. Screenings and resources must be available year round for students and, at a minimum, must (i) include validated screening tools for depression, an anxiety disorder, an eating disorder, substance use, alcohol-use disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and bipolar disorder, (ii) provide resources for immediate connection to services, if indicated, including emergency resources, (iii) provide general information about all mental health-related resources available to students of the public college or university, and (iv) function anonymously; and (6) At least once per term and at times of high academic stress, including midterm or final examinations, provide students information regarding online screenings and mental health resources, including, but not limited to, stress management.  §18B-21-5.  Establishing policies for training and awareness.  The following policies for training and awareness shall be established: (1) The board of trustees of each public college or university shall designate an expert panel to develop and implement policies and procedures that (i) advise students, faculty, and staff on the proper procedures for identifying and addressing the needs of students exhibiting symptoms of mental health conditions, (ii) promote understanding of the rules of §504 of the federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. §701 et seq ,) and the federal Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. §12101 et seq .) to increase knowledge and understanding of student protections under the law, and (iii) provide training if appropriate. (2) The Technical Assistance Center under section eight of the article shall set initial standards for policies and procedures to ensure statewide consistency. (3) All resident assistants in a student housing facility, advisors, and campus security of a public college or university shall participate in a national Mental Health First Aid training course or a similar program prior to the commencement of their duties. Training must include the policies and procedures developed by the public college or university.  §18B-21-6 . Peer Support.  (a) Because peer support programs may be beneficial in improving the emotional wellbeing of the student population, each public college or university shall develop and implement peer support program utilizing student peers to support individuals living with mental health conditions on campus.

Local Assistance.  (a) Each public college or university shall form strategic partnerships with local mental health service providers to improve overall campus mental wellness and augment on-campus capacity. The strategic partnerships shall include linkage agreements with off-campus mental health service providers that establish a foundation for referrals for students when needs cannot be met on campus due to capacity or preference of the student. The strategic partnerships shall also include (i) avenues for on-campus and off-campus mental health service providers to increase visibility to students via marketing and outreach, (ii) opportunities to engage the student body through student outreach initiatives like mindfulness workshops or campus-wide wellness fairs, and (iii) opportunities to support awareness and training requirements under this Act. (b) Through a combination of on-campus capacity, off-campus linkage agreements with mental health service providers, and contracted telehealth therapy services, each public college or university shall attempt to meet national standards regarding counselor to student ratio. Two years after the effective date of this Act, and once every five years thereafter, the Technical Assistance Center developed under §18B-21-8 of this code  shall propose to the West Virginia Higher Education Policy Commission (HEPC) and the Community and Technical College System of West Virginia (CTCS) an updated ratio based on actual ratios in this state and any new information related to appropriate benchmarks for clinician-to-student ratios with the goal to meet national standards. (c) Each public college or university shall work with local resources, such as on-campus mental health counseling centers or wellness centers, local mental health service providers, or non-providers, such as affiliates of the National Alliance on Mental Illness, and any other resources to meet the awareness and training requirements of this Act.

(e)  Expansion of mental health and substance use prevention efforts through partnership with the state’s prevention lead organizations and college’s academic and student services departments shall be encouraged. The West Virginia Collegiate Initiative to Advance Healthy Campus Communities (WVCIA) currently provides a network with resources for institutions to promote prevention efforts. Coordination with WVCIA will increase campus-based efforts addressing substance misuse and suicide prevention. (f)  Collegiate recovery programs support students in recovery by promoting a healthy, balanced, and meaningful life on campus. They provide the support and resources necessary for students to thrive in their recovery and develop meaning and purpose as they move forward in life. Any public college or university campus without a recovery program will be provided resources for its creation and those with a recovery program will be part of the strategic partnership to improve overall campus mental wellness.  §18B-21-8. Technical Assistance Center.  The West Virginia Higher Education Policy Commission (HEPC) and the Community and Technical College System of West Virginia (CTCS) shall work in collaboration to develop a Technical Assistance Center that is responsible for all of the following: (1) Developing standardized policies for medical leave related to mental health conditions for students of a public college or university, which may be adopted by the public college or university.

Pilot program exempt from certificate of need.  Notwithstanding §16-2D-8 and §16-2D-10 of this code, and except as provided in §16-2D-9 of this code, the Legislature finds that a need exists to study the provision of expanding access to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) imaging services in an ambulatory health care facility as defined in §16-2D-2 of this code. Certificate of need regulations are associated with 3.93 more MRI scans and 3.52 CT scans occurring out-of-state. Since certificate of need regulations appear to cause patients to travel out-of-state more often than patients living in non-CON states, a three-year pilot program for these services shall be initiated on a statewide basis to evaluate whether allowing the acquiring, offering or developing of MRI and CT services in the State of West Virginia in an ambulatory health care setting will drive down the need for West Virginia residents to travel out-of-state for these services thereby enhancing patient care and reducing the cost of such care. At the end of the three-year period, the board will present the Legislative Oversight Commission on Health and Human Resources Accountability with a recommendation regarding whether the pilot program should be terminated, become permanent, or that further study is needed. The recommendation should be based upon data collected during the pilot period, including, but not limited to, the number of patients served during the pilot timeframe, where they were serviced, and the cost of the service. If the board makes no recommendation, then the pilot program shall become permanent.  NOTE: The purpose of this bill is to eliminate birthing centers, ambulatory surgery centers, and ambulatory care centers, from certificate of need review. The bill eliminates birthing centers from exemptions; creates a three-year pilot program for MRI and CT; and directs the board to make a recommendation regarding the pilot program. In the absence of a recommendation, the pilot program will become permanent.

Nondiscrimination with regard to reasonable accommodations related to pregnancy. It shall be an unlawful employment practice for a covered entity to: (1) Not make reasonable accommodations to the known limitations related to the pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions of a job applicant or employee, following delivery by the applicant or employee of written documentation from the applicant's or employee's health care provider that specifies the applicant's or employee's limitations and suggesting what accommodations would address those limitations, unless such covered entity can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business of such covered entity; (2) Deny employment opportunities to a job applicant or employee, if such denial is based on the refusal of the covered entity to make reasonable accommodations to the known limitations related to the pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions of an employee or applicant; (3) Require a job applicant or employee affected by pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions to accept an accommodation that such applicant or employee chooses not to accept; or (4) Require an employee to take leave under any leave law or policy of the covered entity if another reasonable accommodation can be provided to the known limitations related to the pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions of an employee.

Such education shall consist of public service announcements, and earned or paid media outreach to all 55 counties.  chapter 21. public health.  article 4G. maternal health and family support.  §16-4G-1. Legislative Findings. The Legislature finds that pregnancy and childbirth can be incredibly special and powerful experiences. Unfortunately, systemic inequities and a lack of prenatal and postnatal care results in a higher likelihood of mortality and pregnancy-related health issues for Black women in particular. While West Virginia agencies and organizations have dedicated expertise and resources to address these problems, better coordination of resources and programs and development of new approaches are necessary. The Legislature also finds: (a) The United States has the highest maternal mortality rate in the developed world and the only rate that is rising. West Virginia’s overall maternal mortality rate is even higher than the national average. In 2017, West Virginia’s maternal mortality rate was 21.4 per 100,000 compared with 17.4 per 100,000 nationally. (1) The maternal mortality rate is significantly higher among black women, who are three to four times more likely than white women to die from pregnancy-related complications. (2) West Virginia gets an F grade for its preterm birth rate from the March of Dimes. The preterm birth rate was 12.6 percent with inadequate prenatal care and poverty for women between the ages of 15 and 44 identified as contributing factors. (3) The Mountain State’s infant mortality rate is one of the highest in the U.S. at 7.0. The infant mortality rate for the U.S. in 2022 was 5.547 deaths per 1000 live births. (4) Nursing mothers are not sufficiently supported in West Virginia and are suffering negative health consequences and being forced to choose between breastfeeding and earning a paycheck. (5) Babies who are fed breastmilk have stronger immune systems and therefore have higher protection from illnesses and diseases, ranging from the common cold to diabetes. (6) Breastfeeding also has protective factors for the mother, lowering the risk for developing osteoporosis, breast, ovarian, and uterine cancers, and rheumatoid arthritis; breastfeeding may reduce postpartum anxiety and depression. (7) Even with West Virginia’s Pregnant Workers’ Fairness Act, too many nursing mothers are left without the ability to pump at work. Without these accommodations, nursing mothers face serious health consequences, including risk of painful illness and infection, diminished milk supply, or inability to continue breastfeeding. (8) West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources Family Planning Program offers exemplary and beneficial services, but the program is under-resourced and not well known by potential clients. Therefore, family planning is not fully accessible in West Virginia. (9) Contraception and family planning allows people to attain their desired number of children, if any, and to determine the spacing of their pregnancies. (10) The prevention of unintended pregnancies helps to lower maternal illness and disease, and the number of pregnancy-related deaths. Delaying pregnancies in young people who are at increased risk of health problems from early childbearing, and preventing pregnancies among older women who also face increased risks, are important health benefits of family planning. (11) Untreated substance use disorders can have long-term negative impacts on the mother, baby, family, and society. (12) Maternal mental health conditions are the most common complications of pregnancy and childbirth, affecting 1 in 5 women or 800,000 women annually, during pregnancy or the year following pregnancy. (13) Maternal mental health and substance use disorders contribute to the high rate of maternal mortality in the United States, with suicide and drug overdose combined being the leading cause of death for women in the first year following pregnancy. (14) Untreated maternal mental health conditions are estimated to cost the West Virginia  economy $86,000,000 every year due to mother’s lost wages and productivity, and poor health outcomes of mother and baby. (15) Frontline providers who care for women during pregnancy and the first year following pregnancy are often reluctant to screen for maternal mental health conditions, citing lack of education, insurance reimbursement, and resources for affected women. (b) As the rest of the world and states across the nation work to improve maternal health outcomes, rising maternal mortality rates in West Virginia are precipitating a public health crisis, one that puts women of color and all rural women at particular risk. This bill includes a comprehensive set of proposals that will save West Virginians’ lives and improve health outcomes for all. (c) The West Virginia Legislature finds that proper care that women and birthing people deserve should be inclusive, respectful and accessible; regardless of race, ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, marital status, familial status, socioeconomic status, immigration status, incarceration status, or disability.  §16-4G-2.

(c) Application for involuntary custody for examination may be made to the circuit court, magistrate court, or a mental hygiene commissioner of the county in which the individual resides, or of the county in which he or she may be found. A magistrate before whom an application or matter is pending may, upon the availability of a mental hygiene commissioner or circuit court judge for immediate presentation of an application or pending matter, transfer the pending matter or application to the mental hygiene commissioner or circuit court judge for further proceedings unless otherwise ordered by the chief judge of the judicial circuit. (d) The person making the application shall give information and state facts in the application required by the form provided for this purpose by the Supreme Court of Appeals. (e) The circuit court, mental hygiene commissioner, or magistrate may enter an order for the individual named in the application to be detained and taken into custody as provided in §27-5-1 and §27-5-10 of this code for the purpose of holding a probable cause hearing as provided in §27-5-2 of this code. An examination of the individual to determine whether the individual meets involuntary hospitalization criteria shall be conducted in person unless an in person examination would create a substantial delay in the resolution of the matter in which case the examination may be by video conference, and shall be performed by a physician, psychologist, a licensed professional counselor practicing in compliance with §30-31-1 et seq . of this code, a licensed independent clinical social worker practicing in compliance with §30-30-1 et seq . of this code, an advanced nurse practitioner with psychiatric certification practicing in compliance with §30-7-1 et seq . of this code, a physician assistant practicing in compliance with §30-3-1 et seq . of this code, or a physician assistant practicing in compliance with §30-3E-1 et seq . of this code : Provided , That a licensed professional counselor, a licensed independent clinical social worker, a physician assistant, or an advanced nurse practitioner with psychiatric certification may only perform the examination if he or she has previously been authorized by an order of the circuit court to do so, the order having found that the licensed professional counselor, the licensed independent clinical social worker, physician assistant, or advanced nurse practitioner with psychiatric certification has particularized expertise in the areas of mental health and mental hygiene or substance use disorder sufficient to make the determinations required by the provisions of this section. The examination shall be provided or arranged by a community mental health center designated by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Resources to serve the county in which the action takes place. The order is to specify that the evaluation be held within a reasonable period of time not to exceed two hours and shall provide for the appointment of counsel for the individual : Provided, however, That the time requirements set forth in this subsection only apply to persons who are not in need of medical care for a physical condition or disease for which the need for treatment precludes the ability to comply with the time requirements. During periods of holding and detention authorized by this subsection, upon consent of the individual or if there is a medical or psychiatric emergency, the individual may receive treatment. The medical provider shall exercise due diligence in determining the individual’s existing medical needs and provide treatment the individual requires, including previously prescribed medications. As used in this section, ""psychiatric emergency"" means an incident during which an individual loses control and behaves in a manner that poses substantial imminent likelihood of physical harm to himself, herself, or others. Where a physician, psychologist, licensed professional counselor, licensed independent clinical social worker, physician assistant, or advanced nurse practitioner with psychiatric certification has, within the preceding 72 hours, performed the examination required by this subsection the community mental health center may waive the duty to perform or arrange another examination upon approving the previously performed examination. Notwithstanding this subsection, §27-5-4(r) of this code applies regarding payment by the county commission for examinations at hearings. If the examination reveals that the individual is not mentally ill or has no substance use disorder, or is determined to be mentally ill or has a substance use disorder but not likely to cause harm to himself, herself, or others, the individual shall be immediately released without the need for a probable cause hearing and the examiner is not civilly liable for the rendering of the opinion absent a finding of professional negligence. The examiner shall immediately, but no later than 60 minutes after completion of the examination, provide the mental hygiene commissioner, circuit court, or magistrate before whom the matter is pending, and the state hospital to which the individual may be involuntarily hospitalized, the results of the examination on the form provided for this purpose by the Supreme Court of Appeals for entry of an order reflecting the lack of probable cause. (f) A probable cause hearing shall be held promptly before a magistrate, the mental hygiene commissioner, or circuit judge of the county of which the individual is a resident or where he or she was found. If requested by the individual or his or her counsel, the hearing may be postponed for a period not to exceed 48 hours. Hearings may be conducted via videoconferencing unless the individual or his or her attorney object for good cause or unless the magistrate, mental hygiene commissioner, or circuit judge orders otherwise. The Supreme Court of Appeals is requested to develop regional mental hygiene collaboratives where mental hygiene commissioners can share on-call responsibilities, thereby reducing the burden on individual circuits and commissioners. The individual shall be present at the hearing and has the right to present evidence, confront all witnesses and other evidence against him or her, and examine testimony offered, including testimony by representatives of the community mental health center serving the area. Expert testimony at the hearing may be taken telephonically or via videoconferencing. The individual has the right to remain silent and to be proceeded against in accordance with the Rules of Evidence of the Supreme Court of Appeals, except as provided in §27-1-12 of this code. At the conclusion of the hearing, the magistrate, mental hygiene commissioner, or circuit court judge shall find and enter an order stating whether or not it is likely that deterioration will occur without clinically necessary treatment, or there is probable cause to believe that the individual, as a result of mental illness or substance use disorder, is likely to cause serious harm to himself or herself or to others. Any such order entered shall be provided to the state hospital to which the individual may or will be involuntarily hospitalized within 60 minutes of filing absent good cause. (g) Probable cause hearings may occur in the county where a person is hospitalized shall occur in the county from which they reside  The  and the judicial hearing officer may: use videoconferencing and telephonic technology; permit persons hospitalized for substance use disorder to be involuntarily hospitalized only until detoxification is accomplished; and specify other alternative or modified procedures that are consistent with the purposes and provisions of this article to promote a prompt, orderly, and efficient hearing. The alternative or modified procedures shall fully and effectively guarantee to the person who is the subject of the involuntary commitment proceeding and other interested parties due process of the law and access to the least restrictive available treatment needed to prevent serious harm to self or others. (h) If the magistrate, mental hygiene commissioner, or circuit court judge at a probable cause hearing or a mental hygiene commissioner or circuit judge at a final commitment hearing held pursuant to the provisions of §27-5-4 of this code finds that the individual, as a direct result of mental illness or substance use disorder is likely to cause serious imminent harm to himself, herself, or others and because of mental illness or a substance use disorder requires treatment, the magistrate, mental hygiene commissioner, or circuit court judge may consider evidence on the question of whether the individual’s circumstances make him or her amenable to outpatient treatment in a nonresidential or nonhospital setting pursuant to a voluntary treatment agreement. At the conclusion of the hearing, the magistrate, mental hygiene commissioner, or circuit court judge shall find and enter an order stating whether or not it is likely that deterioration will occur without clinically necessary treatment, or there is probable cause to believe that the individual, as a result of mental illness or substance use disorder, is likely to cause serious harm to himself or herself or others. The agreement is to be in writing and approved by the individual, his or her counsel, and the magistrate, mental hygiene commissioner, or circuit court judge. If the magistrate, mental hygiene commissioner, or circuit court judge determines that appropriate outpatient treatment is available in a nonresidential or nonhospital setting, the individual may be released to outpatient treatment upon the terms and conditions of the voluntary treatment agreement. The failure of an individual released to outpatient treatment pursuant to a voluntary treatment agreement to comply with the terms of the voluntary treatment agreement constitutes evidence that outpatient treatment is insufficient and, after a hearing before a magistrate, mental hygiene commissioner, or circuit judge on the issue of whether or not the individual failed or refused to comply with the terms and conditions of the voluntary treatment agreement and whether the individual as a result of mental illness or substance use disorder remains likely to cause serious harm to himself, herself, or others, the entry of an order requiring admission under involuntary hospitalization pursuant to §27-5-3 of this code may be entered. Nothing in the provisions of this article regarding release pursuant to a voluntary treatment agreement or convalescent status may be construed as creating a right to receive outpatient mental health services or treatment, or as obligating any person or agency to provide outpatient services or treatment. Time limitations set forth in this article relating to periods of involuntary commitment to a mental health facility for hospitalization do not apply to release pursuant to the terms of a voluntary treatment agreement: Provided , That release pursuant to a voluntary treatment agreement may not be for a period of more than six months if the individual has not been found to be involuntarily committed during the previous two years and for a period of no more than two years if the individual has been involuntarily committed during the preceding two years. If in any proceeding held pursuant to this article the individual objects to the issuance or conditions and terms of an order adopting a voluntary treatment agreement, then the circuit judge, magistrate, or mental hygiene commissioner may not enter an order directing treatment pursuant to a voluntary treatment agreement. If involuntary commitment with release pursuant to a voluntary treatment agreement is ordered, the individual subject to the order may, upon request during the period the order is in effect, have a hearing before a mental hygiene commissioner or circuit judge where the individual may seek to have the order canceled or modified. Nothing in this section affects the appellate and habeas corpus rights of any individual subject to any commitment order. The commitment of any individual as provided in this article shall be in the least restrictive setting and in an outpatient community-based treatment program to the extent resources and programs are available, unless the clear and convincing evidence of the certifying professional under subsection (e) of this section, who is acting in a manner consistent with the standard of care establishes that the commitment or treatment of that individual requires an inpatient hospital placement. Outpatient treatment will be based upon a plan jointly prepared by the department and the comprehensive community mental health center or licensed behavioral health provider. (i) If the certifying professional determines that an individual requires involuntary hospitalization for a substance use disorder as permitted by §27-5-2(a) of this code which, due to the degree of the disorder, creates a reasonable likelihood that withdrawal or detoxification will cause significant medical complications, the person certifying the individual shall recommend that the individual be closely monitored for possible medical complications. If the magistrate, mental hygiene commissioner, or circuit court judge presiding orders involuntary hospitalization, he or she shall include a recommendation that the individual be closely monitored in the order of commitment. (j) The Supreme Court of Appeals and the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Resources shall specifically develop and propose a statewide system for evaluation and adjudication of mental hygiene petitions which shall include payment schedules and recommendations regarding funding sources. Additionally, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Resources shall also immediately seek reciprocal agreements with officials in contiguous states to develop interstate/intergovernmental agreements to provide efficient and efficacious services to out-of-state residents found in West Virginia and who are in need of mental hygiene services.  §27-5-2a.

(3) ""Hospital"" means a facility licensed pursuant to the provisions of §16-5b-1 et seq. of this code, and any acute care facility operated by the state government that primarily provides inpatient diagnostic, treatment, or rehabilitative services to injured, disabled, or sick individuals under the supervision of physicians. (4) ""Psychiatric emergency"" means an incident during which an individual loses control and behaves in a manner that poses substantial imminent  likelihood of physical harm to himself, herself, or others. (b)(1) If a mental hygiene commissioner, magistrate, and circuit judge are unavailable or unable to be immediately contacted, an authorized staff physician may order the involuntary hospitalization of an individual who is present at, or presented at, a hospital emergency department in need of treatment, if the authorized staff physician believes, following an examination of the individual, that the individual is addicted or is mentally ill and, because of his or her addiction or mental illness, is likely to cause serious imminent harm to himself, herself or to others if allowed to remain at liberty. The authorized staff physician shall sign a statement attesting to his or her decision that the patient presents a harm to himself, herself or others and needs to be held involuntarily for up to 72 hours. The West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals is requested to generate a form for the statement to be signed by the authorized staff physician or other person authorized by the hospital and provided to the individual. (2) Immediately upon admission, or as soon as practicable thereafter, but in no event later than 24 hours after an involuntary hospitalization pursuant to this section, the authorized staff physician or designated employee shall file a mental hygiene petition in which the authorized staff physician certifies that the individual for whom the involuntary hospitalization is sought is addicted or is mentally ill and, because of his or her addiction or mental illness, is likely to cause serious harm to himself, herself, or to other individuals if allowed to remain at liberty. The authorized staff physician shall also certify the same in the individual’s health records. Upon receipt of this filing, the mental hygiene commissioner, a magistrate, or circuit judge shall conduct a hearing pursuant to §27-5-2 of this code. (3) An individual who is involuntarily hospitalized pursuant to this section shall be released from the hospital within 72 hours, unless further detained under the applicable provisions of this article. (c) During a period of involuntary hospitalization authorized by this section, upon consent of the individual, or in the event of a medical or psychiatric emergency, the individual may receive treatment. The hospital or authorized staff physician shall exercise due diligence in determining the individual’s existing medical needs and provide treatment the individual requires, including previously prescribed medications. (d) Each hospital or authorized staff physician which provides services under this section shall be paid for the services at the same rate the hospital or authorized staff physician negotiates with the patient’s insurer. If the patient is uninsured, the hospital or authorized staff physician may file a claim for payment with the West Virginia Legislative Claims Commission in accordance with §14-2-1 et seq. of this code. (e) Authorized staff physicians, mental health professionals, and hospitals and their employees carrying out duties or rendering professional opinions as provided in this section shall be free from liability for their actions, if the actions are performed in good faith and within the scope of their professional duties and in a manner consistent with the standard of care. (f) The West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals is requested, by no later than July 1, 2020, to provide each hospital with a list of names and contact information of the mental hygiene commissioners, magistrates, and circuit judges to address mental hygiene petitions in the county where the hospital is located. The West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals is requested to update this list regularly and the list shall reflect on-call information. If a mental hygiene commissioner, county magistrate, or circuit judge does not respond to the request within 24 hours, a report shall be filed to the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals.

The chief medical officer may discharge the patient 30 days after the notice unless the court of record stays the discharge of the individual. In the event the court stays the discharge of the individual, the court shall conduct a hearing within 45 days of the stay, and the individual shall be thereafter discharged unless the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the individual is a significant and present danger to self or others, and that continued placement at the mental health facility or state hospital is required. If the chief medical officer determines that the individual requires commitment and treatment at the mental health facility or state hospital at any time for a period longer than 90 days, then the individual shall remain at the mental health facility or state hospital until the chief medical officer of the mental health facility or state hospital determines that the individual’s clinical presentation no longer requires further commitment and treatment. The chief medical officer shall provide notice to the court, the prosecuting attorney, the individual, and the individual’s guardian or attorney, or both, if applicable, that the individual requires commitment and treatment for a period in excess of 90 days and, in the notice, the chief medical officer shall describe how the individual continues to meet commitment criteria and the need for ongoing commitment and treatment. The court, prosecuting attorney, the individual, or the individual’s guardian or attorney, or both, if applicable, may request any information from the chief medical officer that the court or prosecuting attorney considers appropriate to justify the need for the individual’s ongoing commitment and treatment. The court may hold any hearing that it considers appropriate. (2) Notice to the court of record and prosecuting attorney shall be provided by personal service or certified mail, return receipt requested. The chief medical officer shall make the following findings: (A) Whether the individual has a mental illness or substance use disorder that does not require inpatient treatment, and the mental illness or serious emotional disturbance is in substantial remission; (B) Whether the individual has the independent ability to manage safely the risk factors resulting from his or her mental illness or substance use disorder and is not likely to deteriorate to the point that the individual will pose a likelihood of serious harm to self or others without continued commitment and treatment; (C) Whether the individual is likely to participate in outpatient treatment with a legal obligation to do so; (D) Whether the individual is not likely to participate in outpatient treatment unless legally obligated to do so; (E) Whether the individual is capable of surviving safely in freedom by himself or herself or with the help of willing and responsible family members, guardian, or friends; and (F) Whether mandatory outpatient treatment is a suitable, less restrictive alternative to ongoing commitment. (3) The individual may not be detained in a mental health facility or state hospital for a period in excess of 10 days after a final commitment hearing pursuant to this section unless an order has been entered and received by the facility. (4) An individual committed pursuant to §27-6A-3 of this code may be committed for the period he or she is determined by the court to remain an imminent danger to self or others. (5) If the commitment of the individual as provided under subdivision (1) of this subsection exceeds two years, the individual or his or her counsel may request a hearing and a hearing shall be held by the mental hygiene commissioner or by the circuit court of the county as provided in subsection (a) of this section.

1706184,Relating to infant and maternity mortality,"""WEST VIRGINIA LEGISLATURE 2023 REGULAR SESSION Introduced House Bill 3506 By Delegates Young, Walker, Hansen, and Hornbuckle [Introduced February 14, 2023; Referred to the Committee on Health and Human Resources] A BILL to amend the Code of West Virginia, 1931, as amended, by adding thereto a new article, designated §16-4G-1, §16-4G-2, §16-4G-3, §16-4G-4, and §16-4G-5, all relating to legislative findings and intent; providing definitions; requiring perinatal facilities in this state to implement evidence-based implicit bias programs for health care professionals in those facilities; to require certain components in such programs; to provide training; and to provide for the compilation and tracking of data on severe maternal morbidity and pregnancy-related deaths and other related matters. Be it enacted by the Legislature of West Virginia:   Article 4G. Dignity in pregnancy act.  §16-4G-1. Dignity in Pregnancy Act named. This article shall be known and may be cited as the ""Dignity in Pregnancy and Childbirth Act.""  §16-4G-2. Legislative findings. (a) The Legislature finds that: (1) Every person should be entitled to dignity and respect during and after pregnancy and  childbirth. Patients should receive the best care possible regardless of their race, gender, age, class, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, language proficiency, nationality, immigration status, gender expression, or religion; (2) The United States has the highest maternal mortality rate in the developed world. About 700 women die each year from childbirth, and another 50,000 suffer from severe complications; (3) For women of color, and particularly black women, the maternal mortality rate  remains three to four times higher than that rate for white women; (4) Forty-one percent of all pregnancy related deaths had a good to strong chance of  preventability; (5) Pregnancy related deaths among black women are also more likely to be miscoded; (6) Access to prenatal care, socioeconomic status, and general physical health do not fully explain the disparity seen in black women's maternal mortality and morbidity rates. There is a growing body of evidence indicating that black women are often treated unfairly and unequally in the health care system; and (7) Implicit bias is a key factor driving health disparities in the treatment of patients of color. At present, health care providers in West Virginia are not required to undergo any implicit bias testing or training. Nor does there exist any system to track the number of incidents wherein implicit prejudice and implicit stereotypes have led to negative birth and maternal health outcomes. (b) It is the intent of the Legislature to reduce the effects of implicit bias in pregnancy, childbirth, and postnatal care so that all people are treated with dignity and respect by their health care providers.  §16-4G-3. Definitions. As used in this article: (1) ""Health care professional"" means a physician or other health care practitioner licensed, accredited, or certified to perform specified physical, mental, or behavioral health care services consistent with his or her scope of practice under the laws of this state. (2) ""Implicit bias"" means a bias in judgment or behavior that results from subtle cognitive processes, including implicit prejudice and implicit stereotypes that often operate at a level below conscious awareness and without intentional control. (3) ""Implicit prejudice"" means prejudicial negative feelings or beliefs about a group that a person holds without being aware of them. (4) ""Implicit stereotypes"" means the unconscious attributions of particular qualities to a member of a certain social group. Implicit stereotypes are influenced by experience and are based on learned associations between various qualities and social categories, including race or gender. (5) ""Perinatal care"" means the provision of care during pregnancy, labor, delivery, and postpartum and neonatal periods. (6) ""Perinatal facility"" means a hospital, clinic, or birthing center that provides perinatal care. (7) ""Pregnancy related death"" means the death of a person while pregnant or within 365 days of the end of a pregnancy, irrespective of the duration or site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to, or aggravated by, the pregnancy or its management, but not from accidental or incidental causes.  §16-4G-4. Implicit bias training. (a) Every perinatal facility in this state shall implement an evidence based implicit bias program for all health care professionals involved in the perinatal care of patients within such facility. (b) An implicit bias program implemented pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall include the following: (1) Identification of previous or current unconscious biases and misinformation; (2) Identification of personal, interpersonal, institutional, structural, and cultural barriers to inclusion; (3) Corrective measures to decrease implicit bias at the interpersonal and institutional levels, including ongoing policies and practices for that purpose; (4) Information on the effects, including, but not limited to, ongoing personal effects, of historical and contemporary exclusion and oppression of minority communities; (5) Information about cultural identity across racial or ethnic groups; (6) Information about communicating more effectively across identities, including racial, ethnic, religious, and gender identities; (7) Discussion on power dynamics and organizational decision-making; (8) Discussion on health inequities within the perinatal care field, including information on how implicit bias impacts maternal and infant health outcomes; (9) Perspectives of diverse, local constituency groups and experts on particular racial, identity, cultural, and provider-community relations issues in the community; and (10) Information on reproductive justice. (c)(1) A health care professional shall complete initial basic training through the implicit bias program based on the components described in subsection (b) of this section. (2) Upon completion of the initial basic training, a health care professional shall complete a refresher course under the implicit bias program every two years thereafter, or on a more frequent basis if deemed necessary by the perinatal facility, in order to keep current with changing racial, identity, and cultural trends and best practices in decreasing interpersonal and institutional implicit bias. (d) Each perinatal facility in this state shall provide a certificate of training completion to another perinatal facility or a training attendee upon request. A perinatal facility may accept a certificate of completion from another perinatal facility to satisfy the training requirement contained in this code section from a health care professional who works in more than one perinatal facility. (e) If a health care professional involved in the perinatal care of patients is not directly employed by a perinatal facility, the facility shall offer the training to such health care professional.  §16-4G-5. Data collection and reporting. (a)(1) The Department of Health and Human Resources shall collect and track data on severe maternal morbidity, including, but not limited to, all of the following health conditions: (A) Obstetric hemorrhage; (B) Hypertension; (C) Preeclampsia and eclampsia; (D) Venous thromboembolism; (E) Sepsis; (F) Cerebrovascular accident; and (G) Amniotic fluid embolism. (2) The data on severe maternal morbidity collected pursuant to this subsection shall be published at least once every three years, after all of the following have occurred: (A) The data has been aggregated by state regions, as defined by the department, to ensure data reflects how regionalized care systems are or should be collaborating to improve maternal health outcomes, or other smaller regional sorting based on standard statistical methods for accurate dissemination of public health data without risking a confidentiality or other disclosure breach; and (B) The data has been disaggregated by racial and ethnic identity. (b)(1) The department shall collect and track data on pregnancy related deaths, including, but not limited to, all of the conditions listed in subsection (a) of this code section, indirect obstetric deaths, and other maternal disorders predominantly related to pregnancy and complications predominantly related to the postpartum period. (2) The data on pregnancy related deaths collected pursuant to this subsection shall be published, at least once every three years, after all of the following have occurred: (A) The data has been aggregated by state regions, as defined by the department, to ensure data reflects how regionalized care systems are or should be collaborating to improve maternal health outcomes, or other smaller regional sorting based on standard statistical methods for accurate dissemination of public health data without risking a confidentiality or other disclosure breach; and (B) The data has been disaggregated by racial and ethnic identity.

1694606,Relating to infant and maternity mortality,"""WEST VIRGINIA LEGISLATURE 2023 REGULAR SESSION Introduced House Bill 3257 By Delegate Young [Introduced February 03, 2023; Referred to the Committee on Health and Human Resources] A BILL to amend the Code of West Virginia, 1931, as amended, by adding thereto a new article, designated §16-4G-1, §16-4G-2, §16-4G-3, §16-4G-4, §16-4G-5, relating to legislative findings and intent; providing definitions; requiring perinatal facilities in this state to implement evidence-based implicit bias programs for health care professionals in those facilities; to require certain components in such programs; to provide training; and to provide for the compilation and tracking of data on severe maternal morbidity and pregnancy-related deaths and other related matters. Be it enacted by the Legislature of West Virginia:   Article 4G. Dignity in pregnancy act.  §16-4G-1. Dignity in Pregnancy Act named. This article shall be known and may be cited as the ""Dignity in Pregnancy and Childbirth Act.""  §16-4G-2. Legislative findings. (a) The Legislature finds that: (1) Every person should be entitled to dignity and respect during and after pregnancy and  childbirth. Patients should receive the best care possible regardless of their race, gender, age, class, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, language proficiency, nationality, immigration status, gender expression, or religion; (2) The United States has the highest maternal mortality rate in the developed world. About 700 women die each year from childbirth, and another 50,000 suffer from severe complications; (3) For women of color, and particularly black women, the maternal mortality rate  remains three to four times higher than that rate for white women; (4) Forty-one percent of all pregnancy related deaths had a good to strong chance of  preventability; (5) Pregnancy related deaths among black women are also more likely to be miscoded; (6) Access to prenatal care, socioeconomic status, and general physical health do not fully explain the disparity seen in black women's maternal mortality and morbidity rates. There is a growing body of evidence indicating that black women are often treated  unfairly and unequally in the health care system; and (7) Implicit bias is a key factor driving health disparities in the treatment of patients of  color. At present, health care providers in Georgia are not required to undergo any implicit bias testing or training. Nor does there exist any system to track the number of  incidents wherein implicit prejudice and implicit stereotypes have led to negative birth and maternal health outcomes. (b) It is the intent of the General Assembly to reduce the effects of implicit bias in  pregnancy, childbirth, and postnatal care so that all people are treated with dignity and  respect by their health care providers.  §16-4G-3. Definitions. As used in this article: (1) ""Health care professional"" means a physician or other health care practitioner licensed, accredited, or certified to perform specified physical, mental, or behavioral health care services consistent with his or her scope of practice under the laws of this state. (2) ""Implicit bias"" means a bias in judgment or behavior that results from subtle cognitive processes, including implicit prejudice and implicit stereotypes that often operate at a level below conscious awareness and without intentional control. (3) ""Implicit prejudice"" means prejudicial negative feelings or beliefs about a group that a person holds without being aware of them. (4) ""Implicit stereotypes"" means the unconscious attributions of particular qualities to a member of a certain social group. Implicit stereotypes are influenced by experience and are based on learned associations between various qualities and social categories, including race or gender. (5) ""Perinatal care"" means the provision of care during pregnancy, labor, delivery, and postpartum and neonatal periods. (6) ""Perinatal facility"" means a hospital, clinic, or birthing center that provides perinatal care. (7) ""Pregnancy related death"" means the death of a person while pregnant or within 365 days of the end of a pregnancy, irrespective of the duration or site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to, or aggravated by, the pregnancy or its management, but not from accidental or incidental causes.  §16-4G-4. Implicit bias training. (a) Every perinatal facility in this state shall implement an evidence based implicit bias program for all health care professionals involved in the perinatal care of patients within such facility. (b) An implicit bias program implemented pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall include the following: (1) Identification of previous or current unconscious biases and misinformation; (2) Identification of personal, interpersonal, institutional, structural, and cultural barriers to inclusion; (3) Corrective measures to decrease implicit bias at the interpersonal and institutional levels, including ongoing policies and practices for that purpose; (4) Information on the effects, including, but not limited to, ongoing personal effects, of historical and contemporary exclusion and oppression of minority communities; (5) Information about cultural identity across racial or ethnic groups; (6) Information about communicating more effectively across identities, including racial, ethnic, religious, and gender identities; (7) Discussion on power dynamics and organizational decision-making; (8) Discussion on health inequities within the perinatal care field, including information on how implicit bias impacts maternal and infant health outcomes; (9) Perspectives of diverse, local constituency groups and experts on particular racial, identity, cultural, and provider-community relations issues in the community; and (10) Information on reproductive justice. (c)(1) A health care professional shall complete initial basic training through the implicit bias program based on the components described in subsection (b) of this  section. (2) Upon completion of the initial basic training, a health care professional shall complete a refresher course under the implicit bias program every two years thereafter, or on a more frequent basis if deemed necessary by the perinatal facility, in order to keep current with changing racial, identity, and cultural trends and best practices in decreasing interpersonal and institutional implicit bias. (d) Each perinatal facility in this state shall provide a certificate of training completion to another perinatal facility or a training attendee upon request. A perinatal facility may accept a certificate of completion from another perinatal facility to satisfy the training requirement contained in this Code section from a health care professional who works in more than one perinatal facility. (e) If a health care professional involved in the perinatal care of patients is not directly employed by a perinatal facility, the facility shall offer the training to such health care professional.  §16-4G-5. Data collection and reporting. (a)(1) The department shall collect and track data on severe maternal morbidity, including, but not limited to, all of the following health conditions: (A) Obstetric hemorrhage; (B) Hypertension; (C) Preeclampsia and eclampsia; (D) Venous thromboembolism; (E) Sepsis; (F) Cerebrovascular accident; and (G) Amniotic fluid embolism. (2) The data on severe maternal morbidity collected pursuant to this subsection shall be published at least once every three years, after all of the following have occurred: (A) The data has been aggregated by state regions, as defined by the department, to ensure data reflects how regionalized care systems are or should be collaborating to improve maternal health outcomes, or other smaller regional sorting based on standard statistical methods for accurate dissemination of public health data without risking a confidentiality or other disclosure breach; and (B) The data has been disaggregated by racial and ethnic identity. (b)(1) The department shall collect and track data on pregnancy related deaths, including, but not limited to, all of the conditions listed in subsection (a) of this Code section, indirect obstetric deaths, and other maternal disorders predominantly related to pregnancy and complications predominantly related to the postpartum period. (2) The data on pregnancy related deaths collected pursuant to this subsection shall be  published, at least once every three years, after all of the following have occurred: (A) The data has been aggregated by state regions, as defined by the department, to  ensure data reflects how regionalized care systems are or should be collaborating to  improve maternal health outcomes, or other smaller regional sorting based on standard statistical methods for accurate dissemination of public health data without risking a  confidentiality or other disclosure breach; and (B) The data has been disaggregated by racial and ethnic identity.  NOTE: The purpose of this bill is to require perinatal facilities in this state to implement evidence-based implicit bias programs for health care professionals in that facility; to require certain components in such programs; to provide training; and to provide for the compilation and tracking of data on severe maternal morbidity and pregnancy-related deaths and other related matters.

1657978,Requiring medical insurance providers to include infertility services in their policies,"""WEST VIRGINIA LEGISLATURE 2023 REGULAR SESSION Introduced Senate Bill 175 By Senator Caputo [Introduced January 13, 2023; referred to the Committee on Health and Human Resources; and then to the Committee on Finance] A BILL to amend the Code of West Virginia, 1931, as amended, by adding thereto a new article, designated §33-15F-1, §33-15F-2, §33-15F-3, §33-15F-4, §33-15F-5, §33-15F-6, and §33-15F-7, all relating to requiring medical insurance providers to include infertility services in their policies; making findings; providing for determination of infertility; providing prohibited and permissible limitations on coverage; requiring rulemaking; establishing an effective date; providing for severability; and defining terms. Be it enacted by the Legislature of West Virginia:   ARTICLE 15F. access to fertility care.  §33-15F-1. Findings. The Legislature hereby finds that infertility is a disease of the reproductive system that affects one in six couples. One-third of infertility is due to male factors, one-third to female factors, and the remainder is attributed to factors in both partners or diagnostically unexplained. Some of the individuals impacted are women born without a uterus, men with azoospermia (no sperm), women with uterine abnormalities or endometriosis, women with a history of ectopic pregnancies, cancer survivors, and military veterans who received explosive shrapnel injuries. Infertility is treatable. Ninety-seven percent of infertility cases are treated with conventional drug therapy or surgical procedures. Only three percent of cases require assisted reproductive technology, such as in vitro fertilization (IVF). IVF can be a cost-effective treatment option because, with insurance benefits, patients are known to make health care decisions based on appropriate medical advice rather than financial concerns, and thus transfer fewer embryos per cycle. This can result in a savings of $80,000 or more per pregnancy in maternity care and neonatal care costs. Individuals facing medical conditions where treatment, like chemotherapy, is known to impact future fertility, as well as hopeful parents who are carriers for serious genetic conditions, are also impacted by a lack of affordable access to fertility care. The Legislature finds that it is in the public interest to make medical treatment for infertility and related conditions affordable for West Virginia residents and employers, so as to attract and retain young families, expand the state’s health care resources, reduce overall health care costs, and improve health outcomes for the resulting children.  §33-15F-2. Definitions.  For the purposes of this article: ""Commissioner"" means the Insurance Commissioner. ""Experimental infertility procedure"" means a procedure for which the published medical evidence regarding risks, benefits, and overall safety and efficacy is not sufficient to regard the procedure as an established medical practice. ""Fertility treatment"" means health care services or products provided with the intent to achieve a pregnancy that results in a live birth with healthy outcomes. ""Health carrier"" means an entity subject to the insurance laws and rules of this state, or subject to the jurisdiction of the commissioner, that contracts or offers to contract, to provide, deliver, arrange for, pay for, or reimburse any of the costs of health care services, including an insurance company, a health maintenance organization, a health service corporation, or any other entity providing a plan of health insurance, health benefits, or health services. ""Infertility"" means a disease, caused by an illness, injury, underlying disease, or condition, where an individual’s ability to become pregnant or to carry a pregnancy to live birth is impaired, or where an individual’s ability to cause pregnancy and live birth in the individual’s partner is impaired. ""Medically necessary"" means health care services or products provided to an enrollee for the purpose of preventing, stabilizing, diagnosing, or treating an illness, injury, or disease or the symptoms of an illness, injury, or disease in a manner that is: (A) Consistent with generally accepted standards of medical practice; (B) Clinically appropriate in terms of type, frequency, extent, site, and duration; (C) Demonstrated through scientific evidence to be effective in improving health outcomes; (D) Representative of ""best practices"" in the medical profession; and (E) Not primarily for the convenience of the enrollee or physician or other health care provider. ""Standard fertility preservation services"" means procedures consistent with established medical practices and professional guidelines published by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine or the American Society of Clinical Oncology.  §33-15F-3. Diagnosis of infertility, fertility treatment, and fertility preservation.  (a)  Each health carrier that issues or renews any group policy, plan, or contract of accident or health insurance providing benefits for medical or hospital expenses, shall provide to certificate holders of such insurance coverage for the diagnosis of the etiology of infertility. (b) Each health carrier that issues or renews any group policy, plan, or contract of accident or health insurance providing benefits for medical or hospital expenses, shall provide to certificate holders of such insurance coverage for medically necessary fertility treatment. Enrollees shall be provided coverage for evaluations, laboratory assessments, medications, and treatments associated with the procurement of donor eggs, sperm, and embryos. (c) Each health carrier that issues or renews any group policy, plan, or contract of accident or health insurance providing benefits for medical or hospital expenses, shall provide to certificate holders of such insurance coverage for fertility preservation when a person is expected to undergo surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, or other medical treatment that is recognized by medical professionals to cause a risk of impairment of fertility. Coverage under this section shall include coverage for standard fertility preservation services, including the procurement and cryopreservation of embryos, eggs, sperm, and reproductive material determined not to be an experimental infertility procedure. Storage shall be covered from the time of cryopreservation for the duration of the policy term. Storage offered for a longer period of time, as approved by the health carrier, shall be an optional benefit.  §33-15F-4. Prohibited and permissible limitations on coverage.  (a) No health carrier shall: (1) Impose deductibles, copayments, coinsurance, benefit maximums, waiting periods, or any other limitations on coverage for required benefits which are different from those imposed upon benefits for services not related to infertility or any limitations on coverage of fertility medications that are different from those imposed on any other prescription medications. (2) Impose preexisting condition exclusions or preexisting condition waiting periods on coverage for required benefits or use any prior diagnosis of or prior treatment for infertility as a basis for excluding, limiting, or otherwise restricting the availability of coverage for required benefits. (3) Impose limitations on coverage based solely on arbitrary factors including, but not limited to, number of attempts or dollar amounts or age, or provide different benefits to, or impose different requirements required of other patients. (b) Limitations on coverage shall be based on clinical guidelines and the enrollee’s medical history. Clinical guidelines shall be maintained in written form and shall be available to any enrollee upon request. Standards or guidelines developed by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, or the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology may serve as a basis for these clinical guidelines. Making, issuing, circulating, or causing to be made, issued or circulated, any clinical guidelines that are based upon data that are not reasonably current or that do not cite with specificity any references relied upon shall constitute an unfair and deceptive act and practice in the business of insurance. (c) This article may not be construed to provide benefits for: (1) An experimental infertility procedure; (2) Nonmedical costs related to third party reproduction; or (3) Reversal of voluntary sterilization. (d) In instances where an enrollee is utilizing a surrogate or gestational carrier due to a medical cause of infertility unrelated to voluntary sterilization or failed reversal, the enrollee’s coverage shall not extend to medical costs relating to the preparation for reception or introduction of embryos, oocytes, or donor sperm into a surrogate or gestational carrier.  §33-15F-5. Rulemaking.  The commissioner shall propose rules for legislative approval in accordance with §29A-3-1 et seq. of this code to implement this article. Until such rules are adopted, health carriers shall fulfill their obligations under this article by conforming to the standards of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine.  §33-15F-6.
