It provides exceptions and immunity to an institution for a licensee's intentional or unintentional use of a firearm while carrying it under the act. The bill seeks to acknowledge that violence against disarmed law-abiding citizens is an increasing, but unnecessary, occurrence. The bill is an attempt by the Legislature to reaffirm a law-abiding citizen's Second Amendment Right, the right to protect themselves by allowing legally licensed and permitted employees, staff, and students of public universities the right to legally carry a concealed weapon within specified limitations.", "pending_committee_id": 4, "committee": {"committee_id": 4, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 1, "name": "Education"}, "referrals": [{"date": "2023-01-11", "committee_id": 4, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 1, "name": "Education"}], "history": [{"date": "2023-01-11", "action": "Filed for introduction", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 1, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2023-01-11", "action": "To Education then Judiciary", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 1, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2023-01-11", "action": "Introduced in House", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 1, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2023-01-11", "action": "To House Education", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 1, "importance": 1}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 22824, "person_hash": "3g87xo6t", "party_id": "2", "state_id": 48, "party": "R", "role_id": 1, "role": "Rep", "name": "Chris Pritt", "first_name": "Christopher", "middle_name": "Todd", "last_name": "Pritt", "suffix": "", "nickname": "Chris", "district": "HD-036", "ftm_eid": 44272268, "votesmart_id": 177746, "opensecrets_id": "", "knowwho_pid": 653124, "ballotpedia": "Chris_Pritt", "bioguide_id": "", "sponsor_type_id": 1, "sponsor_order": 1, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [{"type_id": 2, "type": "Similar To", "sast_bill_number": "SB104", "sast_bill_id": 1653740}, {"type_id": 2, "type": "Similar To", "sast_bill_number": "HB2633", "sast_bill_id": 1660796}], "subjects": [{"subject_id": 130072, "subject_name": "Education (Higher)"}], "texts": [{"doc_id": 2633509, "date": "0000-00-00", "type": "Introduced", "type_id": 1, "mime": "text/html", "mime_id": 1, "url": "https://legiscan.com/WV/text/HB2421/id/2633509", "state_link": "http://www.wvlegislature.gov/Bill_Status/bills_text.cfm?billdoc=hb2421%20intr.htm&yr=2023&sesstype=RS&i=2421", "text_size": 116162, "text_hash": "26bc327ce84fba7e5209d633cb79a7b5"}], "votes": [], "amendments": [], "supplements": [], "calendar": []}}
