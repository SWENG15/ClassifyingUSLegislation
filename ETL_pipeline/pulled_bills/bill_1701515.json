The bill imposes excise tax on receipts derived from carbon offset agreements. The bill sets forth reporting requirements. The bill provides an effective date. The bill defines \"managed timberland\" to exclude timberland that is subject to a carbon offset agreement. The bill specifies application of West Virginia Tax Procedure and Administration Act and West Virginia Tax Crimes and Penalties Act. The bill authorizes promulgation of rules.

The bill provides that any covenant, restriction, condition, easement, contract, lease, deed, agreement, option, or other governing document, which is executed or recorded after the effective date, which effectively prohibits or restricts the development of land, minerals, and the harvesting of timber for the purposes of forest carbon capture, carbon offset, and carbon sequestration is void and unenforceable, unless said covenant, restriction, condition, easement, contract, lease, deed, agreement, option, or other governing document is for a maximum term of 20 years. The bill provides that options to renew or continue such arrangements beyond the initial maximum term of 20 years shall be valid only if the consideration is required to be renegotiated to exercise the option.", "pending_committee_id": 26, "committee": {"committee_id": 26, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 2, "name": "Finance"}, "referrals": [{"date": "2023-02-09", "committee_id": 26, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 2, "name": "Finance"}], "history": [{"date": "2023-02-09", "action": "Filed for introduction", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 2, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2023-02-09", "action": "To Finance", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 2, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2023-02-09", "action": "Introduced in Senate", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 2, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2023-02-09", "action": "To Finance", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 2, "importance": 1}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 20553, "person_hash": "lec8nrl2", "party_id": "2", "state_id": 48, "party": "R", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Eric Tarr", "first_name": "Eric", "middle_name": "Junior", "last_name": "Tarr", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-004", "ftm_eid": 15950813, "votesmart_id": 177679, "opensecrets_id": "", "knowwho_pid": 650847, "ballotpedia": "Eric_Tarr", "bioguide_id": "", "sponsor_type_id": 1, "sponsor_order": 1, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}, {"people_id": 19382, "person_hash": "73zqdbmk", "party_id": "2", "state_id": 48, "party": "R", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Patrick Martin", "first_name": "Patrick", "middle_name": "Stephen", "last_name": "Martin", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-012", "ftm_eid": 39705553, "votesmart_id": 167426, "opensecrets_id": "", "knowwho_pid": 565879, "ballotpedia": "Patrick_Martin_(West_Virginia)", "bioguide_id": "", "sponsor_type_id": 2, "sponsor_order": 2, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}, {"people_id": 22845, "person_hash": "ycl82zk3", "party_id": "2", "state_id": 48, "party": "R", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Jack Woodrum", "first_name": "Jack", "middle_name": "David", "last_name": "Woodrum", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-010", "ftm_eid": 48823053, "votesmart_id": 131522, "opensecrets_id": "", "knowwho_pid": 729625, "ballotpedia": "Jack_Woodrum", "bioguide_id": "", "sponsor_type_id": 2, "sponsor_order": 3, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}, {"people_id": 15837, "person_hash": "bod7st3a", "party_id": "2", "state_id": 48, "party": "R", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Randy Smith", "first_name": "Randy", "middle_name": "E.", "last_name": "Smith", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-014", "ftm_eid": 6700943, "votesmart_id": 135450, "opensecrets_id": "", "knowwho_pid": 393307, "ballotpedia": "Randy_Smith_(West_Virginia)", "bioguide_id": "", "sponsor_type_id": 2, "sponsor_order": 4, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [], "subjects": [{"subject_id": 57, "subject_name": "Economic Development"}, {"subject_id": 130124, "subject_name": "Real and Personal Property"}], "texts": [{"doc_id": 2690267, "date": "0000-00-00", "type": "Introduced", "type_id": 1, "mime": "text/html", "mime_id": 1, "url": "https://legiscan.com/WV/text/SB595/id/2690267", "state_link": "http://www.wvlegislature.gov/Bill_Status/bills_text.cfm?billdoc=sb595%20intr.htm&yr=2023&sesstype=RS&i=595", "text_size": 26687, "text_hash": "49b815ebc4840348b2ebd1b822515be0"}], "votes": [], "amendments": [], "supplements": [{"supplement_id": 308972, "date": "0000-00-00", "type": "Fiscal Note", "type_id": 1, "title": "Fiscal Note", "description": "Tax & Revenue Department, WV State", "mime": "text/html", "mime_id": 1, "url": "https://legiscan.com/WV/supplement/SB595/id/308972", "state_link": "http://www.wvlegislature.gov/Fiscalnotes/FN(2)/fnsubmit_recordview1.cfm?RecordID=862662842", "supplement_size": 12140, "supplement_hash": "4ceae8afe262a6aae7dd46a9a5ff8c0f"}], "calendar": [{"type_id": 1, "type": "Hearing", "date": "2023-02-20", "time": "15:00", "location": "Room 451-M", "description": "Senate Finance Committee Meeting"}]}}
