This bill adds mathematics to existing programs and goals from kindergarten to third grade and incorporates science of reading instruction, which can include phonics, phonemic awareness, vocabulary, fluency, and comprehension. Furthermore, this bill requires Pre-K level teachers and staff to utilize early learning reporting systems and requires benchmark assessments or screeners for kindergarten through third grade in reading and mathematics to determine proficiency. Additionally, third grade students who have nonproficient scores in mathematics or the English language arts on the West Virginia General Summative Assessment must continue with intervention programs until he or she is grade level proficient. The bill emphasizes the importance of the students' support systems both in the classrooms and at home. Thus, this bill maximizes family engagement by requiring open and honest communication between the school, the student, and the students' parents or guardians. By the end of the third grade, if the student is still unable to meet minimums requirements by the end of the third grade, the teachers and the student assistance team may recommend that the student be held back. This bill provides additional classroom social, emotional, and academic support for first, second, and third grade pupils by requiring an early childhood classroom assistant teacher in first, second, and third grade classrooms that have more than 12 pupils. The school aid formula allowance for service personnel is amended to increase the number of state funded positions. This bill requires early childhood classroom assistant teachers to exercise authority and control over students such as required of a teacher, but only in instances enumerated by the principal and excluding suspensions and expulsions and performing instructional duties as a teacher. This bill also creates the Grow Your Own West Virginia Pathway to Teaching Program to improve recruitment, retention, and diversity of educators in West Virginia public schools. The Program establishes a process to be administered by the West Virginia Department of Education. Any West Virginia school district can apply to establish its own unique Grow Your Own Pathway Program. Applicants must provide a detailed explanation of how their proposed Program will be run, including partnerships with institutions of high education and whether the Program anticipates providing last dollar tuition and related educational financial assistance to candidates accepted into their Program who commit to teaching a minimum of 3 years, upon licensure, in the Applicant's school district. In evaluating applications that meet the West Virginia Department of Education's criteria, if funding is limited, the Department will give additional weight to Applicants that prioritize recruiting candidates from high-need schools, placing teacher candidates in high-need schools, develop programs that support teacher professionals, including bilingual candidates and those without bachelor's degrees, and leverage apprenticeship and year-long teacher residency models. The West Virginia Department of Education will annually provide Program data to the Legislative Oversight Commission on Education Accountability including the number of Program applications, the number of programs supported including names of districts, and retention rate for educator candidates hired by the district.", "pending_committee_id": 6, "committee": {"committee_id": 6, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 1, "name": "Finance"}, "referrals": [{"date": "2023-01-25", "committee_id": 4, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 1, "name": "Education"}, {"date": "2023-02-20", "committee_id": 6, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 1, "name": "Finance"}], "history": [{"date": "2023-01-25", "action": "Filed for introduction", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 1, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2023-01-25", "action": "To Education then Finance", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 1, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2023-01-25", "action": "Introduced in House", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 1, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2023-01-25", "action": "To House Education", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 1, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2023-02-20", "action": "With amendment, do pass, but first to Finance", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 1, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2023-02-20", "action": "To House Finance", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 1, "importance": 1}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 16935, "person_hash": "z71q43et", "party_id": "2", "state_id": 48, "party": "R", "role_id": 1, "role": "Rep", "name": "Roger Hanshaw", "first_name": "Roger", "middle_name": "", "last_name": "Hanshaw", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "HD-033", "ftm_eid": 21776835, "votesmart_id": 148481, "opensecrets_id": "", "knowwho_pid": 476312, "ballotpedia": "Roger_Hanshaw", "bioguide_id": "", "sponsor_type_id": 1, "sponsor_order": 1, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}, {"people_id": 817, "person_hash": "jdzrbpgd", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 48, "party": "D", "role_id": 1, "role": "Rep", "name": "Doug Skaff", "first_name": "Doug", "middle_name": "", "last_name": "Skaff", "suffix": "Jr.", "nickname": "", "district": "HD-035", "ftm_eid": 6487054, "votesmart_id": 52599, "opensecrets_id": "", "knowwho_pid": 270054, "ballotpedia": "Douglas_Skaff_Jr.", "bioguide_id": "", "sponsor_type_id": 2, "sponsor_order": 2, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [], "subjects": [{"subject_id": 83, "subject_name": "Governor -- Bills Requested By"}], "texts": [{"doc_id": 2662307, "date": "0000-00-00", "type": "Introduced", "type_id": 1, "mime": "text/html", "mime_id": 1, "url": "https://legiscan.com/WV/text/HB3035/id/2662307", "state_link": "http://www.wvlegislature.gov/Bill_Status/bills_text.cfm?billdoc=hb3035%20intr.htm&yr=2023&sesstype=RS&i=3035", "text_size": 70257, "text_hash": "712b130abf3cf5549b82bbc48adb0635"}], "votes": [], "amendments": [{"amendment_id": 157478, "adopted": 0, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 2, "date": "2023-02-20", "title": "hb3035 h ed am _1", "description": "hb3035 h ed am _1", "mime": "text/html", "mime_id": 1, "url": "https://legiscan.com/WV/amendment/HB3035/id/157478", "state_link": "http://www.wvlegislature.gov/legisdocs/chamber/2023/RS/com_amends/hb3035%20h%20ed%20am%20_1.htm", "amendment_size": 6807, "amendment_hash": "d5555e8866d5e1d2d4e98ee587e517ba"}], "supplements": [{"supplement_id": 303805, "date": "0000-00-00", "type": "Fiscal Note", "type_id": 1, "title": "Fiscal Note", "description": "Education, WV Department of", "mime": "text/html", "mime_id": 1, "url": "https://legiscan.com/WV/supplement/HB3035/id/303805", "state_link": "http://www.wvlegislature.gov/Fiscalnotes/FN(2)/fnsubmit_recordview1.cfm?RecordID=860773521", "supplement_size": 9437, "supplement_hash": "e1e92619c1edf8f929f400509df9013f"}], "calendar": []}}
