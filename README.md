This is the base template for the US State Legislation website for SWENG. 

# Run the Website
The website is implemented using Pyscript.
It is run using Visual Studio Code.
1. Install pyscript extension, along with the Live Server extension. Live Server allows you to run pyscript directly in your browser.
2. Go to Settings in Visual Studio Code, then search for “Format on save”, and uncheck the box "Editor: Format On Save". This prevents certain python syntax errors.
