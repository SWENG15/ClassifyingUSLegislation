a waiver.  (f) Right

to counsel. â”€  (1) In

any proceeding under this article, the child shall have counsel to represent

his or her interests at all stages of the proceedings.  (2) The

guardian, custodian, or other person standing in loco parentis with the

where the attorney advises the court that she or he is able to represent each

client without impairing her or his professional judgment. If more than one

child from a family is involved in the proceeding, one attorney may represent

approved by the administrative office of the Supreme Court of Appeals. The

Supreme Court of Appeals shall develop procedures for approval and

meaningful opportunity to be heard.  (i) Findings

of the court . â”€ Where relevant, the court shall consider the efforts

of the department to remedy the alleged circumstances. At the conclusion of the

adjudicatory hearing, the court shall make a determination based upon the

evidence and shall make findings of fact and conclusions of law as to whether

the child is abused or neglected and whether the respondent is abusing,

neglecting, or, if applicable, a battered parent, all of which shall be

incorporated into the order of the court. The findings must be based upon

conditions existing at the time of the filing of the petition and proven by

clear and convincing evidence.  (j) Priority

of proceedings. â”€ Any petition filed and any proceeding held under

this article shall, to the extent practicable, be given priority over any other

civil action before the court, except proceedings under Â§48-27-309 of this code

and actions in which trial is in progress. Any petition filed under this

article shall be docketed immediately upon filing. Any hearing to be held at

the end of an improvement period and any other hearing to be held during any

proceedings under this article shall be held as nearly as practicable on

successive days and, with respect to the hearing to be held at the end of an

improvement period, shall be held as close in time as possible after the end of

the improvement period and shall be held within 30 days of the termination of

the improvement period.  (k) Procedural

safeguards . â”€ The petition may not be taken as confessed. A transcript

or recording shall be made of all proceedings unless waived by all parties to

the proceeding. The rules of evidence apply. Following the court's

determination, it shall ask the parents or custodians whether or not appeal is

desired and the response transcribed. A negative response may not be construed

as a waiver. The evidence shall be transcribed and made available to the

parties or their counsel as soon as practicable, if the transcript is required

for purposes of further proceedings. If an indigent person intends to pursue

further proceedings, the court reporter shall furnish a transcript of the

hearing without cost to the indigent person if an affidavit is filed stating

that he or she cannot pay for the transcript.  Part VI.  JUVENILE

PROCEEDINGS    Â§49-4-722.

Conviction for offense while in custody.  (a)

Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, any person who is

18 years of age or older who is convicted as an adult of an offense that he or

she committed while in the custody of the Bureau of Juvenile Services and who

is sentenced for the conviction to a regional jail or state correctional

facility for the offense may not be returned to the custody of the bureau upon

the completion of his or her adult sentence.  (b) Upon the

incarceration in a regional jail or state correctional facility of any person

18 years of age or older who remains subject to the juvenile jurisdiction of

the circuit court for crimes committed in a juvenile facility, the Bureau of Juvenile

Services shall provide written notification to both the circuit court with

juvenile jurisdiction over the person and the judicial authority in the county

where the criminal charges are pending that the person is being detained,

remains in the jurisdiction of a circuit court, and is pending a sentence as an

adult offender. Prior to the imposition of a sentence on the criminal charges,

the juvenile facility in which the adult crime occurred shall inform the

judicial authority in the county with jurisdiction over the criminal offense

which circuit court has juvenile jurisdiction over the person. The judicial

authority in the county with jurisdiction over the criminal offense shall then

notify the circuit court with juvenile jurisdiction over the person. The person

may not be released from custody on the criminal offense until the judicial

authority in the county where the criminal charges are pending has been

notified by the circuit court with juvenile jurisdiction over the person that

it has conducted the hearing required in Â§49-4-722(c) of this code.  (c) Prior to

completion of the adult sentence specified in subsection (a) of this section,

the circuit court having jurisdiction over the underlying juvenile matter shall

conduct a hearing to determine whether the person who has turned 18 years of

age shall remain in the regional jail during pendency of the underlying

juvenile matter or if another disposition or pretrial placement is appropriate

and available: Provided , That the court may not remand a child who

reached the age of 18 years to a juvenile facility or placement during the

pendency of the underlying juvenile matter: Provided, however , That the

Commissioner of the Division of Corrections and Rehabilitation is authorized to

designate a unit in one or more of the institutions under his or her management

to ensure that the detention of any person 18 years of age or older who is

subject to subsection (a) of this section and who remains subject to the

juvenile jurisdiction of a Circuit Court, may be placed in by the Commissioner,

so that the person does not have contact with or come within sight or sound of

any adult incarcerated persons.
