Whereas, working with McKissick Museum at the University of South Carolina, Ms. Rosengarten developed the landmark traveling exhibition in 2002, A Portion of the People: Three Hundred Years of Southern Jewish Life, and co-edited a book by the same name, which has altered the perception historians have about Jewish history and the creation of American Jewish religious identity; and

Whereas, in 2014, Ms. Rosengarten, with the Jewish Historical Society of South Carolina and the Yaschik/Arnold Jewish Studies Program at the College of Charleston, established  the Pearlstine/Lipov Center for Southern Jewish Culture to broaden public knowledge of Southern Jewish experience; and

Whereas, for some three decades, she worked diligently with volunteers to record six hundred oral histories, including panel discussions, presentations, and interviews with individuals in towns and cities across the State to preserve the stories of three generations of Jewish South Carolinians; and 

Whereas, along with the Jewish Historical Society of South Carolina, Ms. Rosengarten planned and implemented numerous meetings of the Society across South Carolina.  She served as the editor of the Jewish Historical Society of South Carolina's semi-annual magazine, producing nearly thirty issues; and

Whereas, in 2010, Ms. Rosengarten co-curated Grass Roots: African Origins of an American Art, a ground-breaking exhibition at the National Museum of African Art, Smithsonian Institution, in Washington, D.C.; and

Whereas, with her husband, Theodore Rosengarten, she led College of Charleston undergraduate and graduate students in study-abroad trips to Holocaust and Jewish cultural sites in Central and Eastern Europe.  She was instrumental developing three pioneering digital public history exhibits; and 

Whereas, in 2016, Ms. Rosengarten co-curated the exhibition, By Dawn's Early Light: Jewish Contributions to American Culture from the Nation's Founding to the Civil War, which was on view at the Princeton University Art Museum and then at the New York Historical Society; and

Whereas, in 2019, she was honored with both the Folk Heritage Award from the South Carolina Arts Commission for her work researching the sweetgrass-basketry tradition for over thirty years and the Order of the Jewish Palmetto, the highest honor of the Jewish Historical Society of South Carolina; and

Whereas, grateful for her many years of distinguished service to preserve the heritage of Jewish history in this State, the South Carolina House of Representatives takes great pleasure in extending best wishes to Dale Rosengarten as she transitions to a richly deserved retirement and the unhurried pace of the days ahead, and the members wish her much enjoyment in her well-earned retirement.

to recognize and honor virginia ""ginny"" siano-eck, founder of seneca's foothills dance conservatory, on her many years of outstanding dance instruction and to congratulate the conservatory on the twentieth anniversary of its production of the nutcracker in december 2022.

Whereas, the South Carolina House of Representatives is pleased to learn that Foothills Dance Conservatory of Seneca recently celebrated a special anniversary: twenty years of annual productions of The Nutcracker ballet, all of which have been spearheaded by the conservatory's founder, Virginia ""Ginny"" Siano-Eck, serving as artistic director; and

Whereas, through Ginny's national reputation, the Christmas 2022 performances of The Nutcracker featured three professional performers engaged from Massachusetts, New York, and California; and

Whereas, Ginny Siano-Eck is an exemplary professional whose service to her profession and to the community is truly outstanding. Her dedication to the arts has helped bring students and the Tri-County area a real-world performing-arts experience. She holds a bachelor's degree in theatre/dance and secondary education from Barat College in Illinois, and she danced professionally for more than twenty years with companies such as the Tony Wilson Dance Company and Chicago Ballet Ensemble. Before starting her own dance studio, she taught dance to high school students for more than twenty years and was an artist-in-residence for the School District of Oconee County; and

Whereas, in 1997, while she was teaching at West Oak High School, it was determined there was no place children could learn classic dance styles in a more formal environment. Foothills Dance Conservatory (FDC) was born, with a focus on correct training. With the help of Lori Sons and Isa Harold in downtown Seneca, they started out with very young students who had received little or no previous dance training, and they added more advanced classes as the children advanced in their skill levels. In 2000, with the help of Ginny's father, Charles Siano, Ginny purchased the property where FDC remains to this day. The building is known as the Charles Siano Center; and

Whereas, through her efforts, the Foothills Conservatory for the Performing Arts (FCPA) was founded in 2000, and since 2002 it has brought together annual productions featuring seasoned professionals from top-level national companies. The Nutcracker's first performance took place at the Pendleton Playhouse, using local amateur dancers. The following year, through Ginny's leadership, the production was moved to the larger, state-of-the-art Brooks Center for the Performing Arts at Clemson University. Because of Ginny's professional associations, in 2004 Pavel Gureyvich, a professional ballet dancer in Boston, joined the production, which drew significant attention and accolades from the community. Professional dancers throughout our country continue to share their talents for these performances in the Tri-County area; and

Whereas, further, FCPA typically hosts a Tri-ARTs-supported experience of The Nutcracker on the Monday following the public performances. (Tri-ARTs is a performing-arts program for school-age children that offers free, or nearly free, tickets.) Each year, performances at the Brooks Center are given for area schools and home-schooled students, always to full houses; and

Whereas, in addition to her dance activities, Ginny is a member of Seneca Women's Literary and Civic Club, the oldest women's club in Seneca. She is also an active member of the Welcome Wesleyan Church and recently has been certified as an Oconee County Emergency Response Team member; and

Whereas, grateful for Ginny Siano-Eck's dedication and excellence in promoting the arts in Seneca, most particularly the art of dance, the House takes great pleasure in saluting her and her fine dance conservatory at the celebration of twenty years of delightful Nutcracker productions. Now, therefore,

Be it resolved by the House of Representatives:

That the members of the South Carolina House of Representatives, by this resolution, recognize and honor Virginia ""Ginny"" Siano-Eck, founder of Seneca's Foothills Dance Conservatory, on her many years of outstanding dance instruction and congratulate the conservatory on the twentieth anniversary of its production of The Nutcracker in December 2022.

TO EXPRESS THE PROFOUND SORROW OF THE MEMBERS OF THE SOUTH CAROLINA HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES UPON THE PASSING OF THOMASENA STOKES-MARSHALL OF MOUNT PLEASANT, TO CELEBRATE HER LIFE, AND TO EXTEND THE DEEPEST SYMPATHY TO HER FAMILY AND MANY FRIENDS.

Whereas, the members of the South Carolina House of Representatives were deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Thomasena Stokes-Marshall of Mount Pleasant on January 6, 2023, at the age of seventy-nine; and

Whereas, born February 13, 1943, in the historically Black settlement of Snowden in Mount Pleasant, the young Thomasena and her family moved to the Bronx of New York City when she was a young child. Educated in New York City's public school system, she went on to earn a Bachelor of Arts degree in Public Administration and Community Organization from New York University; and

Whereas, Ms. Stokes-Marshall began her career as a correctional officer for the New York State Department of Corrections. Five years into her career, she took the exam to become a police officer and in 1968, she began her tenure with the New York Police Department serving as a patrol officer. She climbed the ranks and was promoted to detective where she worked in community affairs. After twenty-four years with the department, she retired her badge in 1991, and along with her husband, Claude, returned to her hometown of Mount Pleasant in 1993 to care for her aging parents; and

Whereas, though she spent much of her life away from the Lowcountry, the Snowden community remained important to her. In 1998, she successfully ran for a seat on Mount Pleasant's Town Council and had the distinction of being the first African American to sit on the council for which she served with diligence and excellence for four terms. She remains the only Black person to have been elected to the town's one hundred eighty-six year-old council. During her seventeen-year tenure, she served as the chairperson of the Council's Planning Committee, chairperson of the Action Committee for Mt. Pleasant's aging population, on the Affordable Housing Task Force Committee, and during her fourth term, she served as the council's Mayor Pro Tem; and

Whereas, a true civic servant, Ms. Stokes-Marshall anchored the town's development of a senior center and formed local institutions to preserve Black historic settlements and celebrate Gullah-Geechee culture. The Thomasena Stokes-Marshall Senior Center opened its doors in 2009 and was an accomplishment she considered one of the greatest of her life.

Whereas, the South Carolina House of Representatives appreciates the outstanding example of Lowndes Hill Baptist Church's godly heritage for one hundred fifty-one years, and the members wish  the congregation many more years of worship and service under the devoted leadership of the current pastor, Reverend Dr. Edward D. Brantley.  Now, therefore,
